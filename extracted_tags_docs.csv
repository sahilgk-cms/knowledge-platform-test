CMS experience in DRR D1.docx,,"Catalyst Group Experience in Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR)





The Catalyst Group has decades of experience in DRR that spans a range of engagements and initiatives including taking response directly to affected communities, information management, research, monitoring and evaluation, vulnerability assessments and policy and strategy design. 



Through some of our key initiatives working with the NGO Coordination Resource Centre (NCRC) in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, and more recently founding and operating the #COVIDActionCollab and Community Action Collab, we have gained experience and insights into partnership, networking and collaboration, successfully bringing together public, private and government players in disaster response and rehabilitation.



Our DRR policy work has given us an appreciation of the strong DRR institutional and governance mechanism in India, with the enactment of the Disaster Management Act 2005, and subsequent creation of Disaster Management Authorities at the national, state and district levels; other associated institutions such as the National Institute of Disaster Management, among others; and mechanisms for early warnings, village level assessments and planning, etc. We understand the need and opportunities to leverage these for community benefit, and to build ground evidence and narratives that can contribute to policy and strengthened disaster governance 



Our approach to DRR has evolved from looking at DRR through a lens of risk reduction to natural disasters, to embedding DRR into a resilience framework, enabling vulnerable communities to not only bounce back from large scale humanitarian crises, but to also prevent and respond to the risks and disasters that are commonplace to these households. This involves looking at the interactions of social, economic, policy, technology and environment and their collective impact on the household’s ability to cope in the event of crises.



This note provides an overview of Catalyst Groups experience in DRR.



Collaborative Platform: Design and Operation

#COVIDActionCollab

Co-founder of the #COVIDActionCollab (CAC), a collaborative with 260+partners pan India.  (2020-2022)



USAID, who funded the CAC Secretariat, afforded CAC a rating of 5, a rating by the donor only for initiatives of excellence.



Disaster Response

Gaja cyclone 2018: Provided relief material to around 3,500 farmer and fisherfolk worth INR 42 lakh, with funding mobilised from institutional and individual donors

Kerala floods 2018: Provided relief material to 1.69 lakh people affected by the floods, engaging with local panchayats. The response was timely and plugged the vacuum of relief materials that were not available in adequate quantities.

COMMUNITY ACTION COLLAB (2022-current)

The Community Action Collab seeks to leverage the assets, experiences and learning from the #COVIDActionCollab towards building resilient and thriving vulnerable communities, effective, efficient and resilient institutions and a dynamic humanitarian response and recovery ecosystem.



DRR and climate adaptability is an important facet of this initiative. 

Towards this the collaborative has been facilitating emergency response with partners the following till March 2024:

Disasters Responded To - 13

People Reached - 77,000 + 

Funds Mobilised (for material distribution) - INR 1.3 crore + 

Funding Partners -  6 (~60% from Donatekart)

Implementation Partners - 30 

Indian States Present In - 14 



Policy/strategy level work

Rapid Appraisal of Salt Pan in Tamil Nadu – followed by a situation analysis of salt workers in Tamil Nadu, with special focus on Tsunami-affected districts, with a view to developing project framework for improving their socio-economic status, for United Nations Team for Recovery Support in Tsunami (UNDP), Chennai (2008)



Information management

Support to NGO Coordination and Resource Centre (NCRC), a public-private partnership to coordinate and support various efforts in tsunami response at Nagapattinam, Tamil Nadu. CMS was involved in managing the outsourced “Information Exchange Communication – IEC” department of the NCRC in the relief, rehab and development phases and was responsible for conducting studies and publications in various sectors – agriculture, fisheries, shelter, children, women, etc.


As a part of support, CMS developed a comprehensive system on information communication to all Stakeholders involved in R&R (district administration, communities, NGOs, donors, thematic experts, volunteers, etc.) in user-friendly formats. The task involved creating and maintaining updated information of all the affected villages on damages, compensations, R&R activities; Government Orders; Lists of NGOs and profiles, etc. This material was processed and disseminated through ready reckoners, process documentations, newsletter, posters, projection, etc (2004-2007)

CMS’ engagement was recognised by UNDP in their publication Tsunami: India-Two Years After To quote: “The creation of a state-level coordination and resource centre, along with a network of district level centres, was key in enhancing partnerships between government and civil society organisations in aid coordination. This network of resource centres is complemented by a web-based Information and Communication Technology (ICT) solution that captures damages, needs and resources available at all levels in recovery efforts. Another objective is to set up village ICT kiosks and Village Information Centres (VICs) and upgrade existing VICs, by generating suitable content that can respond to the recovery needs of the communities. These ICT kiosks would be linked to the district recovery resource centres to effect exchange of information….Of the district level resource centres, the NGO Coordination and Resource Centre (NCRC) Nagapattinam (www.ncrc.in) was the first to evolve.”

Copy of Swasti Experience in the four pillars - eg.docx,,"At risk populations, vulnerability and empowerment



Pragati is an empowerment initiative for women in sex work in Bangalore, India and is one of India’s largest HIV interventions, with street based sex workers. Having been funded by the Gates-Avahan initiative from 2005 to 2012, the HIV component is now funded by NACO and KSAPS. The Pragati initiative has led to the strengthening of Swathi Mahila Sangha (SMS), a CO of sex workers which todays boasts of nearly 9000 members. Conceptualisation, design and implementation support has been led by Swasti. 



Chinana, funded by USAID was a rural model for HIV prevention in the community and among high-risk groups implemented by Swasti. The project covered 80 high priority villages of 5 Talukas in Chikkaballapura district, Karnataka, India. 



Baduku - Community action against stigma and discrimination of PLHIV (South Asia Development Market Place 2008, World Bank). This was a collaborative project between Swasti and three other Community Based Organizations of Sex Workers – namely - Swathi Mahila Sangha, Jyothi Mahila Sangha, Vijaya Mahila Sangha and Bhoruka Charitable Trust. The focus of the project was to build and enhance capacities of women in sex work and women in sex work living with HIV to fight stigma and discrimination. This project was recognised as one of six best practice models in South Asia at the Regional Conference on Stigma and Discrimination in March 2010



Vulnerability mapping of over 50,000 households in the tsunami affected panchayats of Nagapattinam district for NCRC. This was a census study across Nagapattinam using individual household schedules (2005-06) conducted by CMS



Over the past decade, Swasti has mapped high risk groups in 20 states, more than 300 districts, 17,000 towns and 650,000 high risk individuals.  



Swasti in a joint initiative with UNDP and ICRW (International Centre for Research on Women) piloted an innovative project which aimed at working closely with Panchayat Raj Institutions to create an enabling and empowering environment free of HIV related stigma and discrimination. The project was implemented in 5 villages of Nandi Gram Panchayat, Chikkaballapura district, Karnataka. 



Crisis response, social protection and entitlement facilitation



Swathi Nyaya Sanjeevini is the crisis-response mechanism developed by Swasti and Swathi Mahila Sangha which has handled over 3000 incidents of crisis since its inception in 2005 and built the capacity of women to address the issue of gender based violence. This mechanism has now been evolved into a protocol for the entire city of Bangalore and adopted by other COs in the city to address violence. The work in Bangalore has led to approval for development of Delhi master plan to address the issue of gender based violence using an ecosystem approach. Swasti presented the Bangalore model at the International Symposium on State and Social Movements: Violence, Health and Food Security by Purdue University, US; Held in IIT, Chennai between 13-14th Mar 2013. 



A study of social protection systems across 8 states (Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, UP, Nagaland and Delhi) sponsored by UNDP and NACO and conducted by Vrutti Livelihoods Resource Centre along with Swasti. The study captured varied experiences on the implementation of social protection for PLHIV in the country.



Swasti has implemented project Utkarsha, to promote access to social entitlements, legal protection and employment options for high-risk groups and PLHIV in Karnataka, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh working in 12 districts and 45 organizations. The models developed were able to significantly improve uptake of different government schemes. 



Based on the models developed under project Utkarsha, a manual on scale up of social protection has been developed for NACO by Swasti. 



Swasti has also contributed to NACO’s policy and strategy on social protection, also having written the chapter on mainstreaming of social protection in the NACP IV document. 



Swasti worked with ICRW to develop a toolkit on intimate partner violence for women in sex work, from conceptualization to field-testing. The toolkit development actively engaged with two COs in Karnataka. 



Organizational development, Networking and Building Larger Community Constituency



Swathi Mahila Sangha (SMS), a sex work collective was established in 2003 with the purpose of creating an organization that would be able to address issues of sex workers. Swasti has worked with SMS as a partner on the rationale that a project for women in sex work needs to be driven by women themselves. Building SMS has been an objective of the Pragati initiative and the entire capacity development approach has been to help women inform, analyze and decide for themselves—all of which requires capacities. Since 2005, SMS has grown from 13 to over 8000 members and is effectively managing the organization. It has diversified into multiple projects and has management systems in place. SMS has a strong governing board and robust governance mechanism, which complies with all legal and statutory requirements. 



Durjoy Nari Sangha (DNS) is a CO of women in sex work has been the lead sub-recipient under Round 6 of the Global Fund grant in Bangladesh. DNS acts as the lead agency of a consortium of seven other associate organizations to implement the program. DNS has up to 4 projects including the GFATM project and needed to develop skills and systems for the monitoring and evaluation of the entire organization. Swasti was part of a team supporting DMS strengthen their M&E systems.



Evaluation of a regional MSM CSS project (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Timor Leste), by Swasti, led to the redesign and approval of the phase 2 of the Global Fund supported project. 

Swasti implemented the Supportive Supervision System for KSAPS with the objective of improving capacity, performance and accountability of CSOs implementing care and support programs as well as TI program for prevention and care of HIV affected and infected population within the Province of Karnataka in India. 



Institutional Review and Technical and Management Support for National Centre for STD and AIDS Control, Nepal was conducted by CMS and Swasti which also led to the development of the Standard Guidelines for implementing Targeted HIV Interventions among most-at-risk populations in Nepal 



Institutional review of Nepal’s National Centre of AIDS and STD Control was done with partners UNDP by CMS



CMS supported the NGO Coordination and Resource Centre (NCRC), a public-private partnership to coordinate and support various efforts in tsunami response at Nagapattinam, Tamil Nadu. CMS was involved in managing the outsourced “Information Exchange Communication – IEC” department of the NCRC in the relief, rehab and development phases and was responsible for conducting studies and publications in various sectors – agriculture, fisheries, shelter, children, women, etc. As a part of support, CMS developed a comprehensive system on information communication to all Stakeholders involved in R&R (district administration, communities, NGOs, donors, thematic experts, volunteers, etc.) in user-friendly formats. The task involved creating and maintaining updated information of all the affected villages on damages, compensations, R&R activities; Government Orders; Lists of NGOs and profiles, etc. This material was processed and disseminated through ready reckoners, process documentations, newsletter, posters, projection, etc. This work was recognized as a good practice in the World Disaster Report, 2005.



Planning & facilitation of PLHIV networks across Asia-Pacific as part of GIPA (Greater involvement for People Living with HIV & AIDS) by Swasti



Technical and management support provided to Arunodaya Network of HIV+ people, APN+, PWN+ and Network for Women’s Equity and Equality (NWEE, a network of 11 COs of women in sex work across 4 States) by Swasti

entitlements by socially excluded people in the pro ject areas. In order to effectively and 
sustainably deliver the objectives of the PACS, the  C S O s  w i l l  n e e d  s t r o n g  f i n a n c i a l  a n d  
programme management systems in place – a need iden tified by the pre-funding appraisal 
findings. Effective financial management and progra mme management will form the basic 
blocks of building the organizational capacities of CSO partners and other CSOs (primarily led by 
the socially excluded).

The Pre-funding Assessment findings brought out tha t many CSO applicants do not have robust 
financial management and governance systems. The pr e-funding appraisals have also clearly 
brought out the need to provide support to the CSOs  to strengthen their financial management 
systems. This is all the more important in the cont ext of PACS where the focus would be on 
building strong accountability and transparency amo ng civil society. Strengthening of financial 
and governance management would help in effective management of PACS programme. 
This component assumes importance because the CSO p artners will handle large amount of 
money under PACS and will require sound financial s ystems in place for effective fund 
management. This will also contribute in building s tronger civil society organizations, one of the 
key mandates of PACS programme. Thus, the Capacity Building Program was initiated by the 
PACS secretariat.  
2. Methodology:  
 
The methodology for the entire capacity building pr ogram was designed at three levels. These 
were:  
a. Prior to designing the workshop: 
 
The methodology at this stage involved “Need Assessment” through: 
• Review of the Findings of the Pre-funding Assessment Reports; 
• Review of reporting requirements as per PACS Finance Manual; 
• Review of training manuals developed during the first phase of PACS (2001-08) 
b. At the stage of designing the workshop: 
 
The methodology at this stage was designed for: 
• Developing Resource Material for the CSOs based upo n the “ Conceptual 
Framework”. 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 6 
 
• Developing Trainer’s manual for conducting the workshop  
• Conducting pilot testing of the Trainer’s manual an d CSO Resource material and 
also testing the adequacy of the design of the workshop 
c. At the stage of delivery of workshop: 
 
The methodology followed at the level of training a imed at delivering a concept 
from a basic level and gradually taking the group t o the required level whereby they 
could gain conceptual understanding on key aspects that are essential to implement 
the learning.

Overview of the Topics Discussed 
5. Expectation Mapping 
 
Each workshop started with mapping of the expectati on of the participants. This provided an 
opportunity to the participants to share their expe ctations from the workshop and the area 
that they would like to be addressed during the wor kshop process. Innovative methods like 
expectation cards were issues where participants could write down about the area they wanted 
to be addressed. This was followed by matching of t he participant expectation with the 
schedule that was developed for the workshop. It wa s found that the schedule was quite 
comprehensive and covered most of the areas. The ex pectation was generally in the area of 
FCRA; Budgeting issues and control processes. Any o ther area for instance TDS issues were also 
incorporated and discussed in the following technic al sessions. This helped in ensuring  greater 
ownership of the process.  
6. Technical Sessions 
 
The areas covered during the workshop were divided into 6 technical sessions. These are as 
follows: 
S.L. No. Topic 
1st Technical Session  Understanding Governance of CSO s: Roles & 
Responsibilities of Board 
2nd Technical Session Basic Financial Management (FM) 
3rd Technical Session  Budgeting; Budgetary Control an d Variance

6th Technical Session  Legal Aspects : Income Tax Law & 
controversies 
 
6.1 Technical Session I:  Understanding Governance o f NGOs: Roles & 
Responsibilities of Board: 
 
I What is Governance?  
 
This session dealt with the developing of understan ding on the meaning of Governance. It was 
explained that Governance in simple terms means “th e way in which an organization is 
managed and administered.” 
After ensuring that some form of clarity is develop ed in understanding the meaning and 
importance of Governance, a case study was given wh ich contained five instances of 
governance failure and participants were expected t o identify the lapses in the governance 
processed in each of these five instances. The resp onses of the participants were good and 
many issues were identified by them. Participants w ere also informed about the right 
procedure to be followed to overcome or avoid such instances.  
This was followed by enumerating following elements of Good Governance: 
 Accountability towards affected. 
 Transparency in actions. 
 Responsiveness towards timeframe. 
 Equity and Inclusiveness – “a feeling of belongingness or ownership”. 
 
It was explained that, it is important to follow th e above mentioned elements, as it results in 
better functioning of the organization. In short it will lead to:

CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 12 
 
 Trust in the organization by its donors, members and the stakeholders. 
 The organization knows where it is going. 
 Ability to weather crises. 
 Financial stability 
II Governance in the past 
It was explained to the participants that Good Gove rnance is not a new terminology. One of the 
principal proponents of good governance was Chankay a and he in his book Arthashastra has 
dealt in detail with this subject. For providing a background the key elements of Arthshastra 
was shared: 
Kautilya’s Arthshastra   was referred which speaks of four principles of governance, which a king 
should exemplify: 
• Raksha Protection 
• Vridhi  Enhancement 
• Palana Maintenance 
• Yogakshema Safeguard 
 
The above four principles were then discussed in th e context of CSO and assessment  was done 
to measure its relevance. Through the discussion following points emerged:   
 
i. Raksha: An NGO has to protect its resources, values and the focus of its vision. Therefore, 
all its systems and acts should consistently contribute towards them. 
ii.  Vridhi: An NGO has to enhance its ability to perform since in a constantly progressing world 
even maintenance of status-quo tantamount to deterioration. 
iii.  Palana: An NGO has to manage and maintain its resources, systems and people in s uch a 
way that they constantly enhance its effectiveness and social relevance. 
iv. Yogakshema: An NGO needs to safeguard its resources, systems, people and the interests 
of its stakeholders against all current and future uncertainties/contingencies.

CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 13 
 
If an NGO aspires to put in place all the above fou r principles of governance then financial 
accountability will automatically start falling in place. 
 
III Flow-Chart Showing the Organizational Structure  and Functions

An NGO needs to ensure that all the stakeholders an d the components reflected in flowchart 
are working in harmony with each other. The Social Accountability Quotient (SAQ) of an 
organization in terms of its governance can be dete rmined from the kind of interface the 
organization is having with it's stakeholders and f unctionaries. All these components are 
interlinked and are complimentary to each other. De ficiency in any one of the systems will 
affect the overall performance of the organization and will not yield the desired result. 
 
IV Different Forms of Registration 
 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 14 
 
Participants were asked to share their awareness ab out the different forms of registration of 
CSOs in India. In all the workshops participants we re able to list the various forms of 
registration available in India. It was then discussed that the most convenient & popular form of 
registration is under The Societies Registration Act, 1860. An organization can also be registered 
as a Trust under the Registration Act, 1908. The other relevant acts are:  
  -  T h e  C h a r i t a b l e  &  R e l i g i o u s  T r u s t  A c t ,  1 9 2 0  
  -  T h e  B o m b a y  P u b l i c  T r u s t  A c t ,  1 9 5 0 .  
However, in the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra a  trust has to be registered with the Charity 
Commissioner. An organization can also be registere d under the Companies Act, 1956 under 
section 25. The above mentioned forms of registrati on are prevalent in India and one has to 
choose keeping in view the purpose and size of the organization. 
 
V Functional areas for ensuring good governance 
 
This was followed by discussion on the functional areas for ensuring good governance.  
The De jure Governance components were explained to consist of the following: 
All registered voluntary organizations are a distin ct legal entity and therefore an artificial legal 
person. 
The legal status of an organization comes with legal obligations such as: 
• Statutory Audit 
• General & Board Meetings 
• Bye-laws Adherence 
• Areas of operation 
• Election of Office Bearers etc. 
The above mentioned are some of the de jure aspects of governance system of a voluntary 
organization. An organization has to complement and  a d d  u p o n  t h e s e  a s p e c t s  t o  b u i l d  a  
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 15 
 
sound governance system, keeping in view the size and the nature of the activities. The flow 
chart on the next page depicts an overall picture o f various person/ committees which go 
on to build an effective governance system. 
 
VI Framework for Sound Governance 
 
Having built an understanding on the functional are as for good governance, the issue of 
framework necessary for discharging functions was d iscussed. It was explained that sound 
governance can only exist if it is in a position to  s a t i s f y  t h e  c a n o n s  o f  o p t i m u m  a n d  f a i r  
existence. 
 
Sound governance ensures clearly defined and docume nted process for making decisions that 
are strictly applied. It is an ethical approach by trustees and involves meaningful 
communication to stakeholders/people associated wit h the organization. Sound governance in 
an organization signifies transparency and disclosu re of all relevant matters declaration and 
management of any conflicts of interest acting in the best interests of beneficiaries 
The Framework for Sound Governance is: 
• Aspiration & Strategy – which is Vision & Mission 
• Human Resources – is to have adequate & appropriate staff 
• Organizational Structure – is to have relevant structure to achieve the Vision& Mission 
• Systems & Infrastructure – is to have in place appropriate systems & infrastructure 
• Organizational Skills – is to ensure that relevant organizational skills are developed 
• Organizational Culture – is to define the way things are done in an organization  
 
VII Organizational Structure 
 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 16 
 
It was explained that the structures of NGOs vary c onsiderably. With the improvement in 
communications, more locally-based groups, referred  t o  a s  g r a s s - r o o t s  o r g a n i z a t i o n s  o r  
community based organizations, have become active a t the national or even the global level. 
The organizational structure depends on Board gover nance, organizational design, inter-
functional co-ordination and job design.   
 
The board of directors is the ultimate governing bo dy of an organization. It enjoys powers as 
provided in the governing document (trust deed, bye  l a w s ,  a n d  a r t i c l e s )  a n d  s o m e  o f  t h e s e  
powers are exercisable at board meetings. The board  o f  a n  o r g a n i z a t i o n  d i r e c t s  a n d  c o n t r o l s  
the management of a company though day-to-day manag ement of the company is the 
responsibility of the management. 
 
More specifically, Organization Design is a formal,  g u i d e d  p r o c e s s  f o r  i n t e g r a t i n g  t h e  p e o p l e ,  
information and technology of an organization. It i s used to match the form of the organization 
as closely as possible to the purpose(s) the organi zation seeks to achieve. Through the design 
process, organizations act to improve the probabili ty that the collective efforts of members will 
be successful. 
 
Inter-functional coordination is defined as the com munication and sharing of information and 
resources, and integration and collaboration of dif ferent functional areas/department. In an 
organization there needs to be a link between the p rogramme manager (or people involved in 
program), finance and accounts department.  
 
Job design refers to the way that a set of tasks, o r an entire job, is organized. It takes into 
account all factors which affect the work, and organizes the content and tasks so that the whole 
job is less likely to be a risk to the employee. Jo b design is sometimes considered as a way to 
help deal with stress in the workplace.

VIII Kinds of Board 
 
In the current context the types of BOARD that are generally seen was discussed:  
• Founding Board- A board consisting of only founding members. This d oes not have any 
rotation and continues with the same members.  
• Founder’s Board- This type of board has high influence of its founde r. The founder sets 
up the organization and even brings his close assoc iates to serve on the board. 
Therefore, the board revolves around the founder. 
• Floundering Board- such type of board has a high turnover of Executive Directors 
and Board Members. Such members most likely lack vision and direction.  A Board with 
planned specific goals and objectives will have the focus to lead the organization down 
the road to success.  This foundation is a prerequisite.  One indication of the 
organization’s health is its Board of Directors. A floundering Board means 
a floundering organization.  
• Flowering Board - This is an ideal governing mechanism. It has got di fferent functional 
demarcations, sub-committees and office bearer. The  board meets regularly, has clear 
decision making processes and term of members. 
 
IX Board Matrix 
 
This was self assessment exercise to assess the str ength of the Board of the organization. 
Participants were asked to rate the Board of its organistaion on the following matrix:

This was followed by the explanation of the matrix and following was shared: 
                                 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the above matrix, one can identify that Board with high skills and experience coupled with 
high learning ability enhances its effectiveness and becomes an effective board. However, only 
high skill and experience with low learning ability makes it a dominating board.  Thus, it was

explained that the Board should have skilled and experiences personnel but it is also necessary 
to have learning ability so that it is able to respond to future changes and challenges.  
Board Matrix gives the character of the board when we look at it from the perspective of Skill 
and Experience and Learning Ability & Cohesiveness of the members. When seen as variable 
different degree of the two personal characteristics of members creates board of different kind. 
Board with less skill and experience as well as learning ability and cohesiveness always struggles 
in making decision and discharging its duty. 
 
Board formed of more skilled and experience but les s learning ability always dominates the 
management and try to influence even the day to day  work of organization. This type of board 
hinders the smooth working of the organization. 
Board with member with less experience and skill bu t high level of learning ability however will 
lack quick decisions and may go wrong in some its d ecision but due to high learning ability pave 
its path with collective decision. This board learn s very fast so can be considered as better then 
above two. 
 
The best combination would be of members with high skill and experience as well as learning 
ability. This type of board is effective board whic h is able to take quick decision and adjust itself 
to the changing scenario for the best result for organization. 
 
X Characteristics of an Effective Board 
 
This was followed by enumerating the characteristic s of the Effective Board. It was discussed 
that NGOs deal in public money for public utility p urposes, however for legal and practical 
purposes the ownership of all funds lie with a grou p of people. A good NGO should exemplify 
openness and transparency by having desirable criteria for selection and rotation of trustees. 
• The board should be ideally between five to ten mem bers unless the legal requirements 
are different. 
• The board members should not be relatives. The comp osition of the board should be 
clearly defined in terms of the diversity of the sk ills required for discharge of the board 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 20 
 
functions. The balance of the board should be maint ained in terms of gender, finance & 
other specialized skills, stakeholders, distance & availability. 
• The board should meet once at least in every quarter. 
• There should be a clearly defined policy for recrui tment, election/selection of trustees 
or board members. The induction of new trustees sho uld be through an open process 
providing the opportunity of being elected/selected  t o  a  w i d e r  g r o u p  o f  s t a k e h o l d e r s .  
The process should include use of methodologies suc h as advertising for new trustees 
through various medium. The board members should re tire and be re-elected on the 
basis of rotation. For instance every two years, a third of the board can retire. Though 
the board members usually get re-elected but the te chnical possibility of replacing the 
entire board in an election process should be avoided. 
• Board Meetings should be held at least once in thre e months. The Agenda containing 
the main issues to be discussed in the meeting shou ld be sent along with the notice for 
the meeting. Minutes of every meeting should be pre pared and bound in a register. The 
minutes book must be signed by the Chairperson. 
 
XI Functions of the Board 
 
The Board sets policies and strategies for the NGO,  in line with the agreed purposes, principles 
and scope of the NGO. It also sets operational guid elines, work plans and budgets for the NGO 
and policy and program support. Many times, it is a lso called on to make funding decisions.  It 
may also establish a framework for monitoring and p eriodic independent evaluation of 
performance and financial accountability of activities supported by the NGO. 
 
One of its main roles is representation of the NGO in the larger community. It represents views 
of the NGO in various constituencies, or within the  N G O  c o m m u n i t y  i n  r e l a t i o n  t o  o u t s i d e  
organizations. It is frequently asked to coordinate with outside agencies, as well as advocate for 
the NGO, and mobilize resources. 
 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 21 
 
In order to be an effective board it is essential that certain board functions are discharged 
effectively. The functions of the Board were then explained to include the following: 
• Being the employer 
• Formulating & Monitoring the Governance Structure 
• Securing & Safeguarding Resources 
• Being the Final Point of Accountability 
• Being a link between external stakeholders and environment 
This was followed by a case study exercise. The dis cussions on the case study help in brining   
clarity on the role of the Board, relationship betw een the CEO and the staff and duties towards 
donors. It was concluded that sound governance promotes the following:

6.2 Technical Session II:  Basic Financial Management : 
 
I Meaning Of Financial Management  
 
The session aimed at developing of basic understand ing of ‘Financial Management’.  It was an 
interactive process and participants came with diff erent answers in response to the question –
‘Meaning of Financial Management ‘. 
It was then explained that Financial Management is management of finance i.e. money and 
other resources or factors. The resources include H uman resource, Assets/equipment, Material 
and money. The way the money is utilized and benefi t is derived shows the financial 
management capability of an organization. During th e session the significance and various 
element of Financial Management System were discussed. 
 Management of Income and Expenditure 
 Budgeting 
 Keeping Financial Records, Books, Statements 
 Effectively manage scarce funds 
 Legal Compliance 
 
Later, it was again told to the participants that f inancial management is not only about 
optimum utilization of resources i.e. value for money  b u t  a l s o  u t i l i z a t i o n  o f  r e s o u r c e s  f o r  
planned activities- value for activity. 
 This was followed by explaining the 7 steps to effective management which were: 
 Setting up Policies  
 Budgeting 
 Internal Controls 
 Accounting Systems 
 Compliances to legal requirements 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 23 
 
 Reporting 
 Audit 
 
These all together constitute overall framework for an efficient Financial Management system. 
II Setting up Policies 
 
Regarding Setting up Policies, it was stated that i t is important to have a Financial Policy, such 
as travel rules, depreciation, inventory valuation at cost, accounting policy (accrual or actual) 
etc. Organizational policy should talk about those aspects that are otherwise not laid down 
anywhere in the organization such as approval limits, approving authority etc.  
Setting up of policies is the foundation of the log ical systemic edifice of an organisation. It 
guides the formulation of the Standard Operating Pr otocol (SOP) of the organisation. It is 
formulated keeping in mind the nature of organisati on and check and balances required to 
safeguard its assets and other resources. Broadly a n organisation should have Finance policy, 
Human Resource Policy, Asset Policy and Administrat ion Policy. However an organisation can 
have other policies related to various matters. Som e of the policies are very crucial for effective 
Financial Management system; they are policy related to;  
• Method of Accounting 
• Cash Payment 
• Procurement 
• Travel 
• Salary 
• Leave and  
• Investment. 
III Budgeting 
 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 24 
 
Budgeting is another aspect which is very important  for monitoring the actual performance or 
the implementation of the project. Budget is even m ore important in NGO’s context as almost 
all the projects have fixed budget which in general  course doesn’t change. The actual work of 
an NGO is much guided by it Budget along with its a ctivity plan. A well formulated budget gives 
a very clear direction to the work. It also works a s control for the actual implementation of the 
project. Since there was exclusive session planned for Budgeting, the participants were only 
given brief input on Budgeting in this session.  
IV Internal Control Systems 
 
An organisation is formed by people working there w ho use the resources to achieve the 
objective of that organisation. When people work in  a group it is imperative to have check and 
balances that would safeguard the resources of the organisation. This is done by imputing 
check and balances in the system in the organisatio n. One person should not be given authority 
to carry out a transaction or work from its incepti on till end. There should be a fair segregation 
of duties so that the work done by one is cross che cked by other to avoid any chance of 
intentional or unintentional errors. Since there wa s exlusive session in Internal Controls, it was 
informed that further details will be discussed in forthcoming session.   
V Accounting Systems 
 
Regarding accounting, a comparison was made between  t h e  a c c r u a l  a n d  c a s h  b a s i s  o f  
accounting. It was explained that in comparison Cas h Basis of Accounting is simpler wherein 
accounting is done when either cash is received or paid. Regarding Accrual Basis of Accounting, 
it was informed that though it is referred to as th e scientific method of accounting, it may so 
happen that under this method, NGOs prepare utiliza tion statements even without incurring 
any expenditure. Hence, in this respect, Cash Basis appears better for NGOs. 
It was also explained that the base of good Financi al Management is the adequacy and 
effectiveness of its accounting system and it invol ves various stages. With the help of the 
following flow chart, various stages in the accounting were discussed.

Flow Chart Showing Stages of Accounting 
 
Accounting system starts with systematically record ing of the financial transaction and ends 
with presenting the state of affairs in the financial reports. The entire system should so made to 
carefully record the transaction to present the qua ntitative picture of work being done by the 
organisation. This would give an idea as to how the  r e s o u r c e s  o f  t h e  o r g a n i s a t i o n  a r e  b e i n g  
utilized. In an NGO accounting system presents actu al financial data that when compared with 
the financial plan gives information about the actu al picture of the project implementation. 
Good and robust accounting system helps management to have information to keep the 
implementation on track. Accounting system, as said  earlier, also produce financial statement 
that provides window to other stakeholders to look into the financial affairs of the organization

VI Compliance to Legal Requirements 
 
Complying with the Law of Land is everyone’s duty t owards the state. It is also important 
because most of the non-compliance comes with penal ty attached with it that results in loss of 
organizational resources. Some of the Acts that may be applicable to an NGO were discussed: 
• Society Registration Act 
•Trust laws 
• Section 25 of Companies Act 
• FC(R)A 
• Income Tax Act 
• Provident Fund 
• Payment of Gratuity Act 
Financial Information provides maximum information for the compliance of most of the above 
Laws. The information for filing of return like tha t of to FC(R)A department (filing of FC3) comes 
from the financial system. Information about the PF  a n d  G r a t u i t y  c o m e s  f r o m  t h e  p a y r o l l  
system, a part of financial system. Thus the compli ance of law of the land too depends much on 
the financial system of the organisation. This help ed in generating awareness on the need for 
timel;y compliance and the various compliances that are necessary for CSOs.  
VII Reporting 
 
The next aspect covered was on the various types of  reports that are applicable for CSOs. Some 
of the internal reports prepared by an organisation on regular basis are; 
1. Trial Balance 
2. Variance Analysis 
3. Fund Utilization Statement 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 27 
 
4. Internal Audit Report 
Monthly trial balance is the summary of balances of  a l l  t h e  l e d g e r  a c c o u n t s .  D u e  t o  u s e  o f  
double accounting system, the total of debit balanc e and that of credit balance should match. 
This is a check to ensure that all the accounting has been done correctly. 
Budget Vs Actual, i.e. the variance analysis finds the deviation of actual income and expenditure 
from the budgeted one so that corrective action can  be taken and the implementation is kept 
on track. 
Fund Wise utilization statement is prepared where f und accounting is done. It gives the status 
of each fund which is then compared with the budget ed figure for taking corrective action, if 
required. 
Internal Audit is done to ensure that all the work and its accounting is done properly. Assets 
and resources of the organization is secured and po licies of the organisation is being followed 
properly. Internal Auditor presents its report to t he management who takes action on the 
observations requiring its attention and action. Ac tion taken report is prepared by the 
management which is then presented to the governing  b o a r d  a l o n g  w i t h  t h e  i n t e r n a l  A u d i t  
Report. 
As already mentioned, the external Reporting is don e for the external stakeholders. The most 
important external reporting is the Annual Statemen t of Accounts. The Annual statement of 
Accounts is Audited by the external Auditors to pre sent his opinion on the state of affairs of the 
organisation. Another major reporting is that of FC 3 required under FC(R)A which is the 
statement of receipt and utilization of foreign source fund. 
For the external grants, organisation has to report  to the donor in the forms prescribed, if any. 
It majorly consists of reporting of utilization of grants on periodical basis. Organisation deducts 
Tax at source from some the specified payment made to various vendors of goods and services. 
The Tax thus deducted is then deposited to the gove rnment account with banks. A return is 
filed with the Income Tax authority to report the T ax thus deducted and deposited. There are 
legal provisions that regulate it.

CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 28 
 
VIII Audit 
 
It was explained that the Audit is the process of e xamination of books of accounts and the 
financial statement by an independent person so as to give his opinion on the state of affairs of 
the organization. In NGO context there are three types of audit involved, they are; 
• Statutory Audit:  
It is audit required to be done as per the provisio n of laws of land. The Audit in India is 
generally done by the Qualified Practicing chartere d Accountants. This is done in line with 
the legal requirement, the report of which is submi tted to the government authority as well 
as to general public. 
• Internal Audit: 
As already discussed, Internal Audit is done for re porting to the management about the 
conduct of work in line with the policies of the or ganisation. Organisation generally 
appoints full time Internal Auditors who may or may  n o t  b e  a  Q u a l i f i e d  C h a r t e r e d  
Accountant. 
• Project Audit: 
Project Audit is specific to a project. The opinion  g i v e n  b y  t h e  A u d i t o r  i s  f o r  t h e  s t a t e  o f  
affairs of the project. Auditors generally attest t he Income & Expense or Receipt & Payment 
Account known as utilization statement. The stateme nt of utilization is generally prepared 
in the format prescribed by the donor funding the p roject that mandate the project Audit. 
The frequency of the Audit is also defined by the D onor. Project Audit too is done by 
Qualified Practicing Chartered Accountants. 
Each of the above elements was discussed as explain ed here. With the above discussions, the 
session on Understanding Financial Management was concluded.

6.3 Technical Session III: Budgeting, Budgetary Contro l and Variance 
Analysis: 
 
I Meaning of Budgeting  
 
The meaning of the tem “Budgeting” was informed as planning in financial terms of an 
organization for a specific period of time.  
It was informed that there is a common myth about b udget, whereby when we agree on a 
budget we believe that we agree on the total amount . However, it was clarified that, we not 
only agree on the total but also on the sub heads. 
 
Some of the reasons for preparing a budget were explained as to: 
 plan & co-ordinate activities 
 calculate estimated income / expenditure 
 communicate the plans 
 motivate staff to achieve the objective 
 monitoring & evaluation 
 
Further it was informed that budget has two sides –  
When we say budget we don’t only talk about expendi ture but also income. Budget doesn’t 
mean how we are going to spend but also that from w here we are going to fund our activities. 
Thus budget is made for expenditure budget that we may call cost plan as well as source of 
funds and incomes that we may call the finance plan. 
Importance of understanding Programme Heads and Nat ural Heads was explained. Need to 
keep certain aspects in mind while preparing a budg et such as making provision for Price 
Increases (Inflation) and for Contingencies was explained. 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 30 
 
II Programme Heads VS Natural Heads 
 
This is a very important concept in budgeting as we ll as accounting. Programme head is the 
broader head representing activity that includes di fferent expenditure like honorarium, travel, 
accommodation, food etc. For example organizing hea lth camp would be a programme head 
that will have expenditures related to Honorarium t o Doctors, travel, accommodation, food. 
The natural heads are the general expenditure heads  l i k e  t r a v e l ,  H o t e l ,  s t a t i o n a r y  e t c  t h a t  
doesn’t change its nature whether it is for one act ivity or another. Travel as an account head 
will remain travel in the programme head ‘Health Ca mp’ as well as ‘Child Education in a 
particular village’. Natural heads are actually kno wn when we further break the expenditure in 
an activity. Generally accounting is also done in n atural heads that with some system is clubbed 
in the programme head. 
The distinction of programme head and natural head is necessary as reporting is generally done 
in line with the budget which is approved for each programme head. 
III Budget & Price Increases (Inflation) Budget and Contingencies 
 
There are hundreds of factors which decide our actu al performance. Some factors are easily 
visible beforehand and so we of course take that in to account while making our plan. Some 
factors are visible but not clear and so however we  take that into consideration while making 
the plan, they cannot be expected to work out in th e same way as planned thus may leave 
some deviation. Above all there are some factors wh ich are not at all visible while making 
planning. We can have a provision of contingencies or reserve in the budget to cover the 
portion of unforeseen expenditure. 
The element of price increase has possibility of as certainment to some extent and so can be 
provided in the budget. We can put some increment of budget year over year so as to cover the 
price increase. The increment can be determined tak ing into consideration the inflation in the 
country. 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 31 
 
However much depend on the donors policy on this, if any. 
During this session, the linkage between budgeting and reporting was also highlighted. It was 
also explained that preparation and implementation of a budget alone does not ensure its 
success. Periodical monitoring and appropriate cont rol measures ensures its success. Budget, 
thus provides the basis for accounting, reporting a nd monitoring.  Further budgetary control 
helps to take appropriate action at the right time to ensure that the objectives are achieved. 
The importance of preparing a periodical budget variance report was also informed. 
At the end of the project period, the budget review  n e e d s  t o  b e  u n d e r t a k e n  s o  a s  t o  d r a w  
learning’s from it and to take appropriate measures  w h i l e  p r e p a r i n g  t h e  s a m e  f o r  t h e  
subsequent period.  
Different methods of preparing budgets such as Incr emental Budgets and Zero Based Budgets 
were explained. 
IV Budget Monitoring 
 
Budget monitoring is the process of observing the a ctual implementation in line with the 
approved budget. It requires continuous observation of the project implementation. 
For any type of monitoring we need to have paramete rs as context for observation. For budget 
monitoring we get the parameters from following basic documents; 
• Project Proposal 
• Narratives to the Proposed Budget 
• Grant Agreement, MOUs etc. 
Project proposal gives a fair idea of the activitie s to be carried out which enables to compare 
the budget and actual.  
Thus we need understand the budget in relation to following; 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 32 
 
• Clear understanding of budget heads and sub-heads, 
• List of activities and expenses involved and  
• Time schedule 
The major work during budget monitoring is to compa re the actual expenses incurred activity 
wise with that of budget. Thus planned activities a re compared with the actual activities and 
actual expenditure is compared with the budgeted expenditure. 
V Budgetary Control 
 
Hitherto, we have seen the budget as guiding 
document and seen the making of that taking into 
account its environment and contents. Now we will 
see the budget as controlling document for the 
project at the time of actual implementation. 
Implementation calls for actually carrying out 
activities envisaged in the plan within the monetar y 
domain of budget. Thus the event of deviating from 
the budget would be considered as deviation from 
the financial track set. Since the deviation which may be positive or negative i.e over 
expenditure or under expenditure may change the ove rall scenario of the project, it is vital to 
monitor it in line with the planned activity. For e xample, in the project of building houses for 
poor where the construction is done step by step wh ich ends basically with the roofing and 
finishing, the over expenditure in case of initial construction steps may leave the house without 
roof and doors. This will be total failure of the project. 
 
Over expenditure however is more threatening, under  e x p e n d i t u r e  t o o  q u e s t i o n s  t h e  
correctness of the planning of the project. 

Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 33 
 
Any major deviation should be noted in particular a nd analysed for the reason. Broadly the 
major negative deviation (income is more than expen se) can be because of lower expense than 
budgeted or higher income received. Major positive deviation (excess of expense over budget) 
can be due to reduced income or increased expenditure. 
For any type of control mechanism we need to have a  reference point. Budget acts as reference 
for the control over actual implementation of the p roject. Thus we have to compare the actual 
happening with that of plan/budget. This can be don e by putting the budget and actual side by 
side and see how different they look like. The targ et is where the deviation is more. Generally a 
margin is set to be acceptable for having more obje ctive approach of control process. 
Management by objective and management by exception very well suit this scenario. 
Comparison statement as mentioned above in itself d oes not serve the purpose of control 
process. It merely gives an idea of deviation that may require our attention. Control process 
means taking action against something which is not favorable.  The deviations which call for 
action can only be determined by the cause bringing  t h e  d e v i a t i o n .  T h i s  a n a l y s i s  f o r  
determining the cause of deviation is variance anal ysis. It should be targeted towards the major 
deviation and trivial things should not be delve in to. In short, excess of analysis would make 
paralysis of analysis. We should set a margin of de viation as acceptable and target only those 
deviations that are out of that margin. This margin  can be set by experts in the development 
sector and sometimes the same is set as policy by t he donors too. However, for managerial 
decision making the same should be dealt with on ca se to case basis on the judgment of the 
core program person in consortium with the finance department. Another important thing is to 
give a look to the previous variance and its analys is and the status of present deviation in 
relation to that. This gives an idea as to what was  the reason of previous deviation and is that 
persisting still or the same is mitigated. The prev ious analysis may give some idea of reason of 
present deviation too. If the cause of deviation is  persisting for long time, the same should be 
taken up more seriously and if necessary the revisi on in the plan and the budget may also be 
considered. 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 34 
 
Depending on the outcome of the analysis, decision has to be made to mitigate the any adverse 
variance in the comparison report. For example, if an activity planned earlier could not be 
started on time there would be deviation of actual expenditure from the budgeted. The 
decision has to be taken as to when the same would take place and rescheduling of activity has 
to be done. This has to be kept as noting till the same activity is completed as this will cause the 
deviation till it would be completed. There may be scores of reason and various alternatives to 
mitigate it. The selection out of the options avail able is the matter of decision making by the 
management. 
It is not always possible to rectify the deviation later or take corrective action. In case of faulty 
planning and cause of deviation being non-rectifiab le, the revision of plan and budget has to be 
restored to. This calls for full study of work done , change in the present scenario in respect to 
the situation prevailing at the time of planning, p ossibilities of work in future and effects of 
them on the plan and budget. Revision should be pre sented in such a way that the change in 
the revised budget from that of original budget is visible. Any change should properly be 
supported by the cause and the action plan to addre ss the problem. Budget revision also calls 
for the rescheduling of activities and fresh narratives to the budget. 
VI Budgetary Control and Books of Accounts 
 
Above all is possible only when we have actual data . The actual data is the output of the books 
of accounts and it would not be available if the sa me has not been updated. Updating of books 
of accounts on regular basis thus becomes imperative for the budgetary control. 
It is not only the updating of books of accounts but also correct updating that would be ensured 
for correct budget variance analysis. In case the b ooking of expense is done in wrong budget 
head, the variance determined would be difficult to  analyze for the reason till it is known that 
wrong booking has been done. Thus wrong booking of expense will make the analysis itself a 
useless affair. 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 35 
 
VII Advantage of Budget and Budgetary Control 
 
As already mentioned, the budgeting requires thorough understanding of the project and 
organization. Thus it enables us to understand the organization and its affairs 
Planning of activities requires better coordination between various cost and responsibility 
centre involved. 
Budget gives a concise and precise quantitative picture of the project and so progress of the 
project can be analyzed in more objective way when seen with the budget and actual expense 
Budget as control tool keeps the cost within limit as well as provide criteria for taking corrective 
action to keep the project on track 
With the above inputs the session on Budgeting was concluded. 
VIII Linkage between Program and Finance 
 
Due to the paucity of time separate session on Linkage between Program and Finance could not 
be undertaken. However, important aspects related with this topic were discussed in the 
Budgeting session. The importance of establishing sustained linkage between Programme and 
Finance Reports was emphasized as they are like two sides of the same coin in any 
development organization. From the stage of planning to the stage of review both Finance and 
programme goes side by side. There is no stage where programme and finance can work in 
isolation. Finance as a support service would have to be there always so that meaningful 
outcome can be achieved.  
The key Issues Existing in Programme & Finance Co-ordination was attributed to the following: 
• Lack of sharing of information –  
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 36 
 
Programme and finance cannot complement each other till there are connected properly with 
continuous and proper communication. Main reason of  t h e  t w o  w o r k i n g  i n  i s o l a t i o n  i n  s o m e  
organization is the lack of proper communication between them. 
• Lack of co-ordination –  
Other issue is the matter of coordination. If not p roperly coordinated, communication alone 
will not give the desired result. For e.g. If prope r feed is not given by the programme 
department, the comparison actual and budgeted expe nditure alone will not have any 
information. Lack of coordination will also result in unsmooth flow of fund for the activities that 
would mar the objective of the project. 
 Lack of understanding on each other’s roles and responsibilities –  
Roles and responsibility of both programme and finance are distinct and so should be 
defined properly. 
 Lack of joint participation in key processes- 
It was explained that there should not be any area of ambiguity for which there arise conflicts 
between two. For e.g. the scope of field visit by t he finance person should always be properly 
spelled out so that programme department doesn’t se e it as encroachment of their work area. 
The Finance also should use the field visits for co nstructive input and value addition rather than 
a check on the field work. Some of the area like bu dgeting and monitoring requires programme 
and finance to work very closely and so it should b e done with proper participation of both the 
department 
The following were listed as needs to be done: 
 Sharing of common information systematically 
 Finance staff to be involved while planning the activity 
 The availability of approved budget with both Finance &  Programme 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 37 
 
 The availability Activity Plan with Finance 
 The sharing of Periodical Budget Comparison Statement with the program staff 
 Analyses the reasons for deviations jointly with Programme  & Finance 
In order to have effective co-ordination between Pr ogramme and Finance, it was shared that 
the following needs to be done: 
 Providing explanatory note to the Finance Report 
 Short term reports for programme should be in terms of the expenditure heads 
 Fund Based accounting and reporting 
 Assessment and Reporting of Non-Cash Contribution 
 Clearly defined norms for Natural Heads and Programme Heads. 
 Capacitation of Programme Staff on Basics of Finance 
 The Note to Accounts should be Programme oriented. 
 The Donor Reporting ideally should be done through a unified report – combining 
Activities and Finance. 
 The area, where the input of both programme and fin ance is required, proper 
communication, coordination and participation shoul d be there. Therefore a proper and 
smooth system of communication should be devised to  cater coordination between the 
two. 
 Finance should be involved in the planning phase of  t h e  p r o g r a m m e  s o  t h a t  o v e r a l l  
objective as well various intricacies are known and  t a k e n  c a r e  o f  a t  t h e  t i m e  o f  
formulating budget. The approved budget should alwa ys be shared with the finance 
department. This is a key document that not only gi ves tool for monitoring and control 
but also helps in correct accounting of expense in heads budgeted. 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 38 
 
 For monitoring and budgetary control mechanism it i s important that the activity plan is 
shared with the Finance. Finance department will no t have to contact programme for 
the explanation of every deviances if the activity plan is there with the finance. 
 One of the basic documents for budgetary control is the comparison statement of actual 
expenditure with that of budget. This document shou ld regularly be shared with the 
program and discussed. The analysis of the variance  which should be the joint effort of 
programme and finance should be properly documented  a n d  k e p t  b y  b o t h  t h e  
department. 
It was then explained that from the above discussio n we can now very understand that proper 
linking of programme with finance would help in ach ieving the objective of the project by 
ensuring better monitoring and control. 
Programme gives valuable inputs to explain the vari ations of actual expense from the budget. 
Variance in itself doesn’t convey much. Only when t he reason for the same is explained by the 
programme, it becomes useful information to take de cision about the corrective actions to 
bring the project on track. The variance of one bud get head has bearing on the implementation 
of the other activity and that too can be explained  by the programme department. Collective 
action of the two departments makes the variance an alysis a powerful tool in achieving the 
overall objective of the organization. 
Finance account for the expense based on the inputs  f r o m  t h e  p r o g r a m m e  a b o u t  t h e  
applicability of expense for a particular project. The fund based accounting is possible only 
when programme communicate to the finance about the  activity and expenditure in line with 
the projects and various funds associated with that . Thus for the information needed for the 
fund accounting, finance department is much depende nt on the feed from programme 
department. 
Another area where much inputs is required from the programme department is required is the 
reporting of the non-cash own mean contribution. Th e non cash contribution is generally not 
witnessed by the finance person as such contributio n in most of the occasions done at the field 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 39 
 
level. The programme department should provide info rmation and supporting for the same. 
The finance department should make the programme pe rsonnel aware of the requirement 
related to recognition of non-cash contribution. 
The programme heads in the budget should be clearly  d e f i n e d  s o  t h a t  p r o p e r  b o o k i n g  o f  
expenditure is done. Programme department should al ways inform as to which programme 
head the expense would fall so that the accounting is done correctly. Correct accounting would 
give the correct picture of actual expense in each programme head and result in meaningful 
analysis. Since the accounting generally is done in the natural head there should be a system for 
referring all the expense to the programme head so that correct and timely reporting can be 
done 
It is not always necessary and possible for the fin ance person to accompany to the field area 
where some event is being carried out. The programm e personnel should be aware of basic 
accounting to deal with finance work required at th at event/activity. Knowledge of basic 
finance is necessary for the programme personnel al so for the regular partner visit and 
monitoring. Generally the vouchers too are checked on sample basis by the programme person 
visiting the partners. Therefore the finance depart ment should capacitate the programme 
department in the basics of financial management so  t h a t  t h e y  c a n  d i s c h a r g e  t h e i r  d u t y  
effectively. The notes to account in the audited fi nancial statement of the project should be 
such that help proper implementation of project so the notes to account should be programme 
oriented. 
With the above, the input on Linking Programme and Finance was concluded. 
6.4 Technical Session IV: Internal Control Procedures: 
 
I Importance of Internal Control  
 
It was explained that the Internal Control System o f an organization consists of all actions that 
are taken to ensure that the objective of the organ ization is achieved. It ensures that 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 40 
 
programmes are conducted effectively with maximum e fficiency and reliable reporting is done. 
It also ensures that all the law of land is properly followed. 
The session started with the case study on Internal Control Procedures. 
The participants worked on a case study exercise wh ich involved group discussion. During the 
discussion, they reflected upon the deficiencies em erged in the given case study instance and 
different types of systems existing in their respec tive organizations. This enabled them to relate 
with the systems existing with the learning derived from the group discussion. 
II Internal Control Procedures

necessary Control procedures which must be followed  b y  a n  o r g a n i z a t i o n  f o r  a n  e f f e c t i v e  
functioning. The following areas where controls are  necessarily to be in place were informed:      
 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 41 
 
III Budgetary Controls 
 
Under Budgetary Controls, it was informed that it needs to be initiated fro m the planning stage 
itself  and defining different parameters in a budg et is very important This enables effective 
monitoring and reviewing of the implementation of the budget. 
An organization makes budget on the basis of plan t o achieve the objective. Budget gives the 
quantitative picture of the plan of action. Along w ith the document for plan of action, budget 
provides a tool to control the implementation of th e project. The actual work is compared to 
the planned work along with the comparison of actua l expenditure with that of planned 
expenditure. The deviation between the actual and p lan/budget is analysed to take corrective 
action.  
Budget is also a tool for the cost control. The bud get gives a standard for the expenditure for 
activities and prevents unnecessary extravagance in  t h e  w o r k .  T h i s  i s  v e r y  i m p o r t a n t  c o n t r o l  
since excess expense in one activity has negative e ffect on the implementation of rest of the 
activities as fewer amounts would be left to carry out some of the other activities.  
Budget as a document prepared at the planning stage  helps in monitoring as well as review of 
activities in line with the expenditure. 
IV Accounting Controls 
 
Regarding Accounting Controls , it was informed that up-to-date accounting record s are to be 
kept. Also regular summaries of accounts must be pr esented to management and Governing 
Board. Records should be reviewed during annual aud it and the Auditor’s recommendations 
must be followed–up by the management. In accounting records , issue of voucher is an 
important aspect. Vouchers are support of a transac tion and acts as a witness. Vouchers are 
cash equivalent; however, self-generated vouchers a re not encouraged. Accounting system is 
the source of actual data for monitoring and contro l of the project by comparing the same with 
the budget. It also gives information of expense vi z a viz the activities carried out. For correct 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 42 
 
picture to present, the books of accounts should be  up to date and give the actual figures to 
date. Failing with the same, the purpose of accounting system would not be properly fulfilled. 
Along with the timely updating of the books of acco unts it is imperative for the accounting to 
be accurate. Wrong accounting will not reflect the true picture of expenditure and the 
comparison statement will not present the correct s tate of affair. For taking correct decision for 
corrective action correct interpretation of the fin ancial 
statement is necessary. Wrong financial statement and 
comparative statement would lead to wrong 
interpretation and wrong decisions. 
The Audit is an integral part of Accounting System and 
ensures that faults and errors in the financial rec ords 
are found on time. Thus it is important to follow u p 
the auditors recommendation so that the accounting 
system generates corrects information. 
V Income Control 
 
Emphasis was laid on the security of incoming funds as very important aspect. Similarly, it was 
informed that the security of incoming mail is also  v e r y  i m p o r t a n t ,  a s  i t  i s  l i k e l y  t o  c o n t a i n  
cheques, grant approval letter or an agreement docu ment which must be opened in secured 
place and in presence of more than one person. Furt her, it was emphasized that for all cash 
received, receipts must be issued immediately and c ash & cheques received should always be 
recorded immediately. A senior staff must make regu lar check to ensure that income records 
are accurate.  
Organization should have systems to secure the inco me of the organization. There are some 
basic checks and control to ensure that money recei ved by the organization is not leaked and 
properly accounted for. Some of such checks and controls are; 

Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 43 
 
• Opening official mails at secured place and in pres ence of more than one person as the 
mails may contain cheques 
• Receipt should be issued immediately for all cash r eceipts. If this system is not in place 
the cash received may go unaccounted and would resu lt in loss of revenue of the 
organization. 
• Any receipt should immediately be recorded in the books of accounts 
• There should be system of regular check to ensure t hat all the incomes are being 
recorded properly on time. 
VI Expenditure Control 
 
Regarding expenditure controls, it was informed that adequate authorization has to be in place. 
A senior staff should authorize the expenditure bef ore it is paid and the person authorizing the 
expenditure should be different from the one who pr epares and signs cheques. Further it was 
emphasized that all payments to suppliers be made against original invoice. 
All the activities of an organization entail expend iture. Unnecessary expenditures or more than 
required expenditure actually means loss of revenue . To ensure that all the expenditures are 
reasonable and required, there should be proper con trol over expenditure. All the expense 
should be done on proper authorization by the perso n conversant with the overall programme 
for which the expenses are done. For e.g. Programme Coordinator of a particular project should 
always be part of approval system so that the viabi lity and validity of expense is properly 
judged. 
VII Purchase Control  
 
Regarding purchase controls, it was informed that purchase orders should be pl aced through 
pre-numbered order forms. In case, orders for more than a specified amount or quantity is to 
be placed, it should be done by formal procedure of  i n v i t i n g  t h r e e  q u o t a t i o n s .  T h e  b a s i s  o f  
deciding on a particular quotation needs to be docu mented. After the purchase process, the 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 44 
 
invoice should be matched against original order and the quality and quantity of goods received 
must be checked and entered in the stock register. 
Another aspect of control system is the purchase pr ocess. Purchases involving considerable 
amount should properly be processed to avoid any po ssibility of excess payment as well as 
inferior products being received. 
There should be proper purchase policy in the organ ization that ensures the correct decision 
about the purchase to be made as well as the vendor from whom it is purchased. It also ensures 
that favorable terms and conditions are put into pl ace. There should also be check on the 
technical aspects of the item purchased.  
Following control would ensure the above; 
• There should be system of obtaining more than one q uotations for all big purchases and 
do comparative analysis (bid analysis) to select th e most economic, qualitative and 
viable option. 
• All the big purchases should be approved in committees specially formed for that 
• Pre numbered Purchase order mentioning the specific ations for the item and the terms 
and conditions of payment should always be prepared to order the purchase of the item 
• On receipt of the item, it should be matched with t he order to ensure that the item 
received is same as ordered 
VIII Control on Bank Accounts  
Other control which is very important is the segreg ation of duty related to authorizing 
expenditure and preparation of cheques between different people. 
As far as possible, the payment should be done only  o n  r e c e i p t  o f  p r o p e r  a n d  o r i g i n a l  
documents supporting the expenditure. Payment to ve ndors should always be done on receipt 
of original invoice. 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 45 
 
Regarding maintenance of bank accounts, it was informed that it must be in the name of th e 
organization. Also, the arrangement of signatories should be clearly decided and based on 
practical requirements (signatories must be available).  
The other aspect was that there should not be one p erson responsible for authorization as well 
as preparation of cheque. For example, if the Finan ce Officer is involved in preparation of 
cheques, s/he should not be a signatory. Most of th e payments should be made by account 
payee cheques to avoid cash payments. It was emphas ized that signing of blank cheques should 
be completely avoided. Money received should be dep osited in the bank as often as practical. 
Especially large cash should not be retained in off ice during weekends and holidays. Regular 
reconciliation of the bank and the cash balances sh ould be made. Unused cheque leaves should 
be kept in safe custody. It was informed that the o rganization should not have too many bank 
accounts. 
Most of the money of the organization is kept with the bank. It is imperative to have a proper 
control over the bank transactions. Among other thi ng that can be, following would ensure 
proper banking operation; 
• The bank account should always be in the name of Organisation 
• The organization should not keep more that required  number of banks and all the non 
operating bank accounts should be closed immediately 
• The signatories should be one who is generally avai lable in the office. In the case 
otherwise, there may arise a requirement of keeping  heavy cash  w hich  involves m ore  
risk 
• The Finance staffs who is involved in the preparati on of cheque should not be the one 
who is authorized to sign the cheques 
• The payment should, to the extent possible, be made through account payee cheques 
• The blank cheques should never be signed even if th ere is possibility of urgent 
requirement of money in absence of the signatories.  T o  m i t i g a t e  t h i s  p r o b l e m  t h e  
second point above should be tried. 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 46 
 
• Cash in access of the minimum balance to be kept sh ould be deposited in bank. Thus 
there should be regular deposit of cash received. 
• Large cash should not be kept in the office during the weekend to avoid any chance of 
theft. Any large sum of cash received should immediately be deposited in bank 
• Bank reconciliation Statement should be made at the end of each month 
• The cheque books should be kept in secured place under the lock and key 
IX Control on Cash 
 
Similarly control systems should also be establishe d in 
managing cash. Appropriate approval limit should be 
set for cash payment to avoid heavy cash payments.  
Cash must be held in a secure place and adequate 
insurance cover must be taken for cash. Only one 
person must be responsible for handling cash. It 
should be ensured that the cashier should be different 
from the person dealing with accounting record. All  
cash receipts & payments must be recorded in the 
Cash Book as soon as possible. Physical verification of cash should be undertaken periodically.  
Control over cash, both transaction and the physical cash is very important since it involves high 
risk. Cash remaining unaccounted is cash lost. Hard  cash is also more prone to theft. Cash if not 
properly handled and monitored may pose problem at the time of cash reconciliation and the 
accountant may get into trouble. Likewise, cash pay ment should also be properly handled as 
cash payment done without accounting for the same may cause the actual cash and the balance 
as per book to mismatch. Cash advance, like advance  to staffs also should be properly recorded 
and tracked. 
• Some of the ways for Cash control are following; 

Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 47 
 
• Cash should always be kept at a secured place withi n lock and key. A person should be 
designated as cash custodian who should be responsi ble for cash transactions and 
keeping track of the same 
• Where there is high cash transaction done and balan ce kept in the office premise is 
large, appropriate cash insurance should be taken. This is true in case of high and 
frequent cash in transits. 
• Cashier/cash custodian and the person recording the transactions should be different 
• There should be system of immediate recording of ca sh transactions in the cash book as 
transaction not entered may remain unaccounted for. 
• Receipt should be issued immediately for all the ca sh received. There should be system 
of triplicate cash receipt. The original receipt sh ould be given to the payee, one carbon 
copy should be attached with the receipt voucher an d another carbon copy should be 
left in the receipt book. The receipt issued should  be pre-numbered. Full receipt book 
should be used before taking out another receipt bo ok which should also be numbered 
chronologically. Receipt books should be kept in th e custody of higher authority and 
issued only after ensuring that the last one is use d. The authority issuing the receipt 
books should verify the last used receipt book before issuing the next. 
• There should be policy for cash payment where maximum possible cash payment should 
be specified. Cash payment over and above the limit  s h o u l d  a l w a y s  b e  s p e c i f i c a l l y  
approved by higher authority. 
• There should be a system of regular cash count and surprise cash count by the senior 
authority. 
X Physical Control  
 
Regarding managing fixed assets and equipments, it was informed that access to valuable items 
e.g., vehicles, computers etc. should be limited to  a u t h o r i z e d  s t a f f .  A l l  i t e m s  s h o u l d  b e  
registered in the name of the organization. The pre mises must also be kept secure with 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 48 
 
sufficient insurance cover. Policy about use of org anizational asset by staff should be in place. 
Also the staff attendance records must be clearly kept. 
Organization’s resources include assets that are used for carrying out the activities for achieving 
the objective. Safeguarding assets of the organizat ion is an important area of internal control 
mechanism. Therefore the access and use of the asse ts should be properly monitored. In doing 
so, following options may be used; 
• There should be proper authorization for using valu able assets like vehicle, Computers 
etc. 
• All the assets should be in the name of the Organisation and not personal name 
• The office premise should be properly secured 
• Proper insurance should be taken for all the assets  o f  t h e  o r g a n i z a t i o n  a s  w e l l  a s  t h e  
office premise. 
• There should a policy for use of assets by staff 
• Above all, there should be detailed and proper reco rd for all the assets and period 
physical verification should be done. Condition of all the assets should be noted and 
assets that are no longer usable should be disposed off after proper authorization. 
XI Control on Advance  
It was informed that control systems regarding adva nces are very important. Clear procedure 
for approval of advances must be th ere incl udi n g follow -u p for o uts tan d ing advance possibly 
made once in a month by the finance department. It should be endured that next advance 
should not be sanctioned if there are advances pend ing settlement. In case, if it takes too long, 
then the salary must be attached / other disciplinary measures taken. 
Advance given to the staff as well as vendors shoul d be settled within the specified period of 
time. Advance if left unsettled for long and not tr acked may remain unsettled forever. This is 
because, the staffs who have taken advance may leav e the organization, the vendor may close 
down etc. In these cases the advance given and not settled would become loss to the 
organization. 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 49 
 
Following would help to avoid the above situations; 
• A clear policy should be made for the advance provi sion as well settlement. Advance 
should be given only on proper authorization. There  s h o u l d  b e  p o l i c y  o f  m a n d a t o r y  
settlement of advance within a specified time limit , say 7 days of completion of travel in 
case of travel advance etc. 
• Status of all the advance should be review at the end of specified period, say a month 
• No second advance should be provided to the same pe rson without the first being 
settled 
• All the balances including the advances should be p roperly checked at the time a staff 
leaves the organization. 
• There should be a recourse for recovery of long due  a d v a n c e s  a n d  a c t i o n  s h o u l d  b e  
taken on time in all such cases 
XII  Segregation of Duties  
Clear segregation of duties  and responsibilities are very crucial in effective  functioning of the 
internal control systems. It is the principle affec ting all areas of Internal Control which aims at 
preventing errors and potential frauds by ensuring that one person is not responsible for the 
entire transaction. In small organizations, sometim es outsiders (auditors) come in and make 
cash verification.  
The principle of internal check where one person’s work is automatically checked by other due 
to the process followed is applicable at each level  a n d  f o r  a l l  t h e  w o r k  w h e t h e r  i t  i s  c a s h  
management, asset management, bank transactions, ac counting or other. Proper segregation 
of duty in itself is a control mechanism which alon g with operational control keeps moral check 
too. 
Segregation of duties also helps in detection of er rors caused by omission or otherwise as well 
as frauds and intentional errors. 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 50 
 
Internal control is must in all organization irresp ective of the size and nature of the 
organization. However the extent and vastness of th e system would depend on the size and 
nature of the organization. 
6.5 Technical Session: V - Legal Aspects - FC(R) A, 2 010  
I Replacement of old FCRA Act 1976 
[[ [[ [[ 
The Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act 2010 and 
the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Rules 2011 
have been enacted w.e.f. 01.05.2011. The old FCR 
Act and Rule, 1976 have been repealed. In this issu e, 
we are discussing the major changes and the impact 
thereof. The new law governing Foreign 
Contribution came into effect from 01.05.2011 
onwards.  
II Provisions of FCRA 2010  
 
There are drastic changes in the FC(R) A 2010 that needs attention of the NGOs receiving 
foreign contributions. The provisions and analysis of the new law was presented in the legal 
session. 
A. Scope of the Act 
 
The scope of the new Act was explained which also i ncluded “person.” Also the scope of the 
foreign contribution was explained which under Sect ion 2(h), means transfer, delivery or 
donation of any currency, article or security. This excludes consultancy or commercial receipt. It 
includes interest or any other income from FC funds  f o r  a s s e t s .  I t  w a s  a l s o  e x p l a i n e d  a b o u t  
persons debarred from receiving foreign contribution. 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 51 
 
B. Organization of Political Nature 
 
It was explained that organizations of political na ture are not eligible for registration under 
FCRA, which was possible under the old Act with pri or permission. Such organizations can not 
apply for even for prior permission. Elaborate Rule s have been framed for notifying any 
organization as an organization of political nature. 
Under Rule 3 the FCRA department may declare any or ganization as an organization political 
nature, if: 
- It has political objectives in its memorandum. 
- It is a trade union. 
- It is a group of political nature. 
- It is like Student Union, Worker Union, Youth Uni on and Women wing of Political   
   party. 
- Any organization if any material evidence found to be engaged in political activity. 
- Any organization found to be engaged in political  activity such as ‘Bandh’, ‘Rasta Roko’, 
‘Rail Roko’ and ‘Jail Bharo’. 
C. Cap on Administrative Expenses 
 
As the new law has put a cap on Administrative expe nses, details of the same was provided as 
follows:  
 Salaries, wages, travel of Board / Trustees. 
 Expenses towards hiring and travel of personnel for management of the activities 
 Consumables 
 cost of accounting for and administering funds; 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 52 
 
 expenses towards running and maintenance of vehicles; 
 cost of writing and filing reports; 
 legal and professional charges; and 
 rent  & repair of premises and other utilities:  
 However it excludes expenditure directly towards activity 
D. Inter-Organizational Transfer of FC Funds 
 
Regarding Transfer of FC funds to another FC regist ered organization, it was explained that Rule 
is contravention of the Act. As per the rule, any p erson intending to transfer foreign 
contribution to another FC registered organization has to make an application to the Central 
Government in Form FC-10. Such transfer of foreign contribution shall be reflected in the 
returns in Form FC-6 as well as in Form FC-10 by th e transferor and the recipient. However, it 
has been clarified by the FCRA department that FC r egistered organization can transfer funds to 
another FC registered organization without any prior permission.  
Regarding Transfer of FC funds to another Non FC re gistered organization, it was informed that 
transfer can be made on prior approval only. The pe rson may apply to the Central Government 
in Form FC-10 to transfer foreign contribution not exceeding 10% of the total value of foreign 
contribution received. Such application should be s ent along with the recommendation of the 
District Magistrate of the areas of the recipient organization.  
E. Renewal of FC Registration 
 
One of the significant provisions of the new law is  t h e  r e n e w a l  o f  r e g i s t r a t i o n  a f t e r  e v e r y  5  
years. It was explained that Renewal of registratio n of NGOs every 5 years. However, 
organizations having registrations under the previo us act have exemption for the first 5 years. . 
In other words, all existing NGOs have to renew the ir registration at the end of the period of 5 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 53 
 
years from the date of enactment of FCRA 2010. This  implies that the renewal of all the existing 
NGOs will become due on 1st May 2016. 
For renewal of registration, an organization has to  apply in Form FC-5, six months before the 
date of expiry of the certificate of registration. It was also informed that NGOs having multi-
year project shall apply for renewal 12 months before the date of expiry. 
In case an NGO fails to apply for renewal within th e due date, its registration shall become 
invalid. However, the department may condone the de lay if satisfactory reasons for not 
submitting the renewal application are provided. Su ch delay should not be for more than 4 
months after the expiry of the original certificate of registration. 
F. Filing of return & method of accounting 
 
Rule 16 provides that the annual return accompanied  by Income and Expenditure statement, 
Receipt and Payment Accountant Balance Sheet shall be submitted by 31st of December. The 
law regarding filing of returns remains, more or le ss unchanged. However, the notable changes 
areas under: 
- The return shall be filed in FormFC-6 and not FC-3 
- For the first time, FC rules are asking for submission of income and expenditure account 
- A copy of bank statement certified by the bank has to be submitted 
- A nil return is required to be filed if there is no activity 
The FCRA 2010 and the Rules thereof do not specify any method of accounting. Section 19 of 
the FCRA 2010 just provides that accounts with rega rd to FC receipt and utilization should be 
maintained. In the past, it was assumed that FCRA r equired cash basis of reporting (if not 
accounting).However, with the new requirement of fi ling Income and Expenditure account 
raises the question whether accrual basis of accoun tings also permissible. On a plain reading of 
section 19 of FCRA 2010, Rule 16 and Form FC-6, it seems that the requirement is to report FC 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 54 
 
funds received and utilized during the year. In other words, the receipt of funds shall be on cash 
basis only but there is no direction regarding util ization payment basis only. FCRA 2010 does 
not seem to be prescribing any fixed method of acco unting. Any method of accounting may be 
followed by the organization but the receipt of FC funds should be reported on cash basis only. 
It seems due to seems due to the inclusion of Incom e and Expenditure account that the 
utilization will be permissible on accrual basis al so if the organization consistently follows 
accrual basis of accounting. However, the proposed Direct Tax Code (DTC) prescribes cash basis 
of computation only. 
G. Which return should be filed for the current year (F Y 2010-11) 
 
The new Rules provide that the annual return shall be filed in Form FC-6. However since the act 
became effective from1st May 2011, it is understood  that the FCRA return for the year 2010-11 
should be filed in the old form FC-3. 
Another significant provision of the new Act is the  power to prohibit sources from which FC can 
be accepted. 
It was explained that the Act provides power to the  Central Government under section 11(3)(iv) 
to notify such source(s) from which foreign contribution shall be accepted with prior permission 
only. It implies that the Central Govt. may notify specific donors or countries from which foreign 
funds could not be received or shall be received with prior permission only. 
H. Additional requirement of Filing Form FC-7 
 
All NGOs are required to file Form FC-7 along with a certificate for Chartered Accountant, if 
they receive contribution in kind. In the old act, there was no such requirement for filing a 
separate return for foreign contribution received i n kind. It may be noted that old Form FC-3 
and the new Form FC-6 both have a column for contri bution received in kind. Therefore, it was 
not necessary to have an additional requirement of filing Form FC-7. However, as it stands, FC-7 
has to file in case of receipt of contribution in kind. 
Final Report of PACS workshops 
 
CPA & FMSF, NOIDA Page 55 
 
I. Preservation of accounting records for 6 years 
 
The Rule 17(7) provides that accounting statements shall be preserved for 6 years. This is a very 
welcome change. Earlier it was seen that the NGOs w ere asked to provide books and records 
for past 10-15 years which was practically not poss ible. This rule will provide a lot of relief to 
the existing NGOs. 
J. Compounding of offence 
 
Section 41 read with Rule 21 provides that the Mini stry of Home Affairs may compound any 
offence punishable under the FCRA Act. When an offe nce is compounded, then such 
organisation is not prosecuted. This is also a posi tive change which will help in avoiding 
needless legal cases. 
With the above inputs the session on FCRA was concluded. 
6.6 Technical Session: VI - Legal Aspects: Income Tax Law & controversies 
 
A. Possible change in the Act 
 
It was explained that presently the Income Tax Act,  
1961 is in effect. However, the government has 
also introduced a Direct Taxes Code which is 
expected to come into effect from 01.04.2012 
onwards. 
 
B. Significant Provisions & 
Controversies in the Income Tax Act 
1961 
 
The session aimed to touch upon some of the signifi cant provisions and controversies in the 
existing law as well as highlight some of the provisions of the forthcoming law.

Way Forward 
 
While delivering the workshops, we found that, most  of the CSO representatives participated in 
the PACS workshops are from the gross rote NGOs.  It was also noticed that, the participants 
were enthusiastic to know good practices of Financi al Management and Governance in 
NGOs. The participants were keen on the Legal compl iances and the recent changes in the 
legal framework affecting their business.  
 
Based on the feedback given by the participants, CS Os are still expecting more training and 
capacity building events on Financial Management an d legal issues. Further, Government is 
also planning to bring some changes in the Legal fr amework and planning to introduce 
Direct Tax Code to replace Income Tax Act 1961.  
 
Thus, it is suggested to conduct a refresher progra mme on the topics delivered in Sep 2011 
to ensure the implementation of sound financial man agement systems and good governance 
practices among the PACS partners. The refresher pr ogramme can also be used to give 
inputs on the latest changes in the legal framework . Further, it is also recommended to 
conduct a workshop on Tally Accounting software so as to enable PACS partners to use the 
advanced future of Tally application such as Budget  monitoring, management of Advances 
etc.,

The Big Problem



How? 
Through Collaborative Action
Relevance now
Overall situation of VUCA 
(Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity)

More pandemics- emergencies are likely in future
Climate crisis is real; climate change events will impact Vulnerable Population the worst

Make communities and institutions resilient

Social development focus on everyday shock is low. More focus on singular domains and  extreme outlier events



How we work
Synergise resource access and allocate efforts, in an adaptive and urgent manner
Augment collaboration and connections, within the larger network, at multiple levels
Accelerate transformative impact in keeping with the changing needs within vulnerable communities

A 
Create a Strong Resume 
 
resume is a concise, informative summary  
of your abilities, education, and experience. 
It should highlight your strongest assets and skills, 
and differentiate you from other candidates seek - 
ing similar positions. Although it alone will not get 
you a job or internship, a good resume is an impor- 
tant element toward obtaining an interview. 
 
Tailor your resume to the type   of   position  
you are seeking. This doesn’t mean that all of 
your experiences must relate directly, but your 
resume should reflect the kind of skills the 
employer would value. 
RESUMES  AND  COVER  LETTERS   
 
 
 
 
 
 
RESUME TIPS 
RESUME LANGUAGE SHOULD BE: 
• Specific rather than general 
• Active rather than passive 
• Written to express not impress 
• Articulate rather than “flowery” 
• Fact-based (quantify and qualify) 
• Written for people who scan quickly 
 
DON’T: 
• Use personal pronouns (such as I) 
• Abbreviate 
• Use a narrative style 
• Use slang or colloquialisms 
• Include a picture 
• Include age or gender 
• List references 
• Start each line with a date 
 
TOP 6 RESUME MISTAKES: 
1. Spelling and grammar errors 
2. Missing email and phone information 
3. Using passive language instead of “action” words 
4. Not well organized, concise, or easy to skim 
5. Not demonstrating results 
6. Too long 
 
DO: 
• Be consistent in format and content 
• Make it easy to read and follow, balancing white 
space 
• Use consistent spacing, underlining, italics, bold, 
and capitalization for emphasis 
• List headings (such as Experience) in order of 
importance 
• Within headings, list information in reverse chron- 
ological order (most recent first) 
• Avoid information gaps such as a missing summer 
• Be sure that your formatting will translate properly 
if converted to a .pdf 
 
PLAN TO WORK INTERNATIONALLY? 
Resume guidelines can vary from country to country. See our 
international resources at ocs.fas.harvard.edu/online-tools

Dear : 
 
Opening paragraph: Clearly state why you’re writing, name the 
position or type of work you’re exploring and, where applicable, how 
you heard about the position or organization. A summary statement 
may work well here by including three reasons you think you would be 
a good fit for the opportunity. 
 
Middle paragraph(s): Explain why you are interested in this employer 
and your reasons for desiring this type of work. If you’ve had relevant 
school or work experience, be sure to point it out with one or two key 
examples; but do not reiterate your entire resume. Emphasize skills or 
abilities that relate to the job. Be sure to do this in a confident manner 
and remember that the reader will view your letter as an example of 
your writing skills. 
 
Closing paragraph: Reiterate your interest in the position, and 
your enthusiasm for using your skills to contribute to the work 
of the organization. Thank the reader for their consideration of

• Remember that this is a marketing tool. Use plenty of action 
words.

Morgan Smith 
Director of Communications 
Jumpstart 
308 Congress Street, 6th Floor 
Boston, MA 02110 
 
Dear Morgan Smith: 
 
I am a senior at Harvard College studying History and Literature. I am writing to apply for the 
Marketing and Communications position at Jumpstart posted in Harvard’s Crimson Careers  
database. I am excited about the field of education, and would welcome the opportunity to bring 
my strong communication skills, creativity, and marketing experience to your growing team. 
 
Jumpstart's commitment to early education for every child is of particular interest to me because 
of my passion for youth development. This past summer, I worked as a senior counselor in the  
Summer Urban Program, which is dedicated to preventing summer learning loss for children in  
the Boston and Cambridge area. I designed and taught fun, interactive classes to a group of 10 
fifth graders, and planned and led local field trips and workshops daily with a junior counselor.  
Throughout the summer, I consistently strived to create math, science, and reading lessons and  
activities that were engaging and tailored to my students' needs. 
 
Additionally, in my role as the Director of Marketing for the Social Innovation Collaborative, I 
led our team in creating a social media strategy to drive our member recruitment efforts and  
promote our programs and events on platforms including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. 
With so many competing events on campus each day, I had to continually be creative in my 
approach to developing and delivering content that would be compelling and effective. As a 
result of my efforts, our group experienced a 20% increase in our membership base and a 15% 
increase in our social media engagement. I’m excited at the prospect of bringing the skills I 
developed through this experience to the Marketing and Communications role at Jumpstart. 
 
Thank you for your consideration. I very much look forward to the opportunity to speak with 
you in person about my interest in this position. 
 
Sincerely,

Background



Why Worker Wellbeing?

A majority of the world’s population spends one-third of their adult life at work (about 40 to 46 hours per week on average). Within workforces across supply chains, health and well-being become more significant, given the occupational health hazards. Sanitation, safety procedures, accident risk, abusive workplace relationships, gender discrimination, forced labor, occupational diseases, and economic vulnerability all pose a risk to workers. 



Within the scope of worker well-being , the garment and textile industry emerges as a key sector of focus as the industry employs 60 to 75 million people out of the world’s working population of 3 billion. The industry’s estimated worth is $4.4 trillion, with global trade totaling $600 billion. The industry accounts for approximately 2% of global GDP with women representing three-fourths of its workforce (Stotz, 2015). This also highlights the importance of promoting enhanced occupational health practices and improved mechanisms to facilitate women's empowerment and gender equity. 



Why a worker well-being intervention in Vietnam and Indonesia? 



Garment workers globally experience distinctive vulnerabilities in the workplace [1, 2]. Among South East Asian countries, these occupational vulnerabilities are related to dangerous and unhealthy working conditions, and employment in sub-standard physical environments. In addition sexual harassment at the workplace, low wages and repetitive strain from physically demanding and intense work also make the workers vulnerable. However, health issues represent the most significant among the vulnerabilities faced by the workers during their working tenure in the readymade garment (RMG) sector [3,4,5]. Yet, the amount of scientific data available on health vulnerabilities is minimal. Thus, the policy-level changes  made toward workers' health is insignificant. The low importance of the health of garment workers is evident. 



The secondary desk research that we have conducted by reviewing various scientific studies, published by public health institutions,  has thrown light on the potential health vulnerabilities among RMG workers in Vietnam and Indonesia.  Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSD) have been highly reported among workers in both countries due to long working hours,  very few breaks, and improper training and knowledge among workers on body postures and techniques to lessen physical aches that stem from their occupation.  The MSD worsens by age and gender causing early retirement/ dropout from work by efficient workers. This in turn adds additional cost to recruiting new workers and training them.  On the other hand, the prevalence of Non-Communicable diseases ( NCD) such as anemia ( V-16.9% I- 24.6% ), diabetes (V-3.92% , I- 10.8 ), hypertension ( 35% ), and mental health issues have spiked in the past decade in both countries. Although these diseases seem to be not directly associated with occupational health hazards, they are attributed to unhealthy workers, who often are absent from work due to sickness. In most cases, the sick workers do report to work, but the productivity is at a toss.  It's important to recognize that there may be hidden costs that have an impact on the business throughout the entire process. By identifying and addressing these costs, we can work towards maximizing efficiency and profitability.



it has been observed that work-related stressors such as long working hours, an abusive workplace environment, lack of autonomy or choice in decision-making, and other similar factors are contributing to a significant rise in the prevalence of depression and suicidal thoughts among employees. The findings of these studies highlight the urgent need for organizations to implement measures that prioritize the well-being of their workforce, to create a safe and healthy work environment for all. Centers for Disease Control ( CDC) suggests that managing diabetes and Hypertension at workp\lace not only makes the individual healthier but also makes them more productive . Likewise,  studies globally have validated the causuallrelationship between Anemia and its direct negative effects on work productivity.



Female garment workers are more prone to risky sexual behaviors due to various reasons such as migration, low wages, power dynamics at the workplace, etc. Which when combined with low knowledge on sexual health and access to preventive products put them at risk of STI’s.  . Although Factories are regulated to provide preventive and promotive health education, nevertheless the stigma, cultural sensitivity and discrimination associated act as hindering blocks to these interventions.  Most of the above health conditions can be addressed through lifestyle modification and early diagnosis which can be done at the factory's doorstep. However,  the clinics are equipped with only one or two staff. Thereby confirming that there is a lack of comprehensive medical care available for any potential health hazard. 



It is crucial to protect the women in the sector who act as the backbone being major contributors to the workforce.  Although the governments had laid out  strict regulations for protecting women’s rights with a special focus on new mothers and children, few industries still have covert practices such as testing women for pregnancy during recruitment such that they can avoid all the expenses ( Maternity benefits) associated with the same.   A study conducted in Vietnam laid out that women take 14 days off from work due to the illness of a sick child. Promoting breastfeeding would interm boost the immunity of the child and reduce the incidence of falling sick thereby reducing absenteeism and improving productivity of the mothers as well . However, both in Vietnam and Indonesia the rates are as low as 24% and 55%. These rates are much lower among garment workers. Various reasons including, low knowledge of breastfeeding, expressing and storing breast milk, and the influence of formula milk are key factors driving the low breastfeeding rates.   There is an immediate need for focussing on maternal and child health among garment workers. 



Due to the workers' health vulnerabilities, lack of knowledge of healthy lifestyles, poor health-seeking behavior, and inadequate access to comprehensive healthcare, the factories are employing an unhealthy workforce. This workforce has low productivity and efficiency,  high attrition, and absenteeism which incurs a hidden cost that contributes to an overall loss for the business.  Hence, there is a need for accessible, affordable, and sustainable health care. 



VFC, with its commitment towards its supply chain, is initiating health intervention to improve the well-being of the workers, which contributes towards improving the lives of garment workers. VFC has approached Swasti to develop a need-based health intervention in their supply chain in Vietnam and Indonesia. Swasti. Swasti has developed this proposal aligning with the objective and needs of garment workers in Vietnam and Indonesia for better healthcare access.



 What’s the Solution? 



Globally there has been an increased movement towards responsible and sustainable business that includes empowering the workforce in supply chains to achieve their health and wellbeing. In this context, several programs have been implemented by Swasti over the last decades to improve the health and wellness of the workforce. These programs have led to tangible outcomes and addressed the needs of the workforce to some extent.



Swasti’s experience of over a decade in designing and implementing various worker wellbeing programs in more than 300 apparel and textile industries across India and 11 countries such as; Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Vietnam, Lesotho, Zambia etc. led to the incubation of  “Invest for Wellness'' or Health@Work. Health@Work is a holistic and sustainable worker wellbeing initiative that aims to deliver quality and affordable health care and wellbeing services to workers at the factory doorstep. This initiative also aims to bring together the different stakeholders in the industrial region for collaborative actions to achieve the health and well-being of the workforce. 



The Wellness Framework and Packages

Swasti uses a comprehensive well-being framework to enhance the health and wellness of the workforce. This framework acts as a lens to understand existing knowledge, behaviour, practices, policies and systems related to worker wellbeing, identify gaps and design an intervention to address the needs of workers and the factory. The program involves both online and onsite approaches to maximize the impact. Swasti shall trainin and strengthen the workforce in the factories to carry out the interventions and Swasti aims to provide technical and handholding support as the factories takeover the programmatic interventions. 



The following four packages will be delivered to enhance the health and wellness of the workforce-



(1)Primary Health  Health

 (2) Promotion of Workplace relationships and Lifeskills 

(3) Financial Inclusion and Social Protection.







Package I: Primary Health Care: 

The package focuses on preventive and promotional actions, chronic case management and use of technology for health data management. It will operate through four  key pillars- 



1.1 Systematic Screening & Treatment through Strengthening the Factory Clinics 



The program will ensure the strengthening of clinics to enable factory clinic staff to treat workers' health issues using primary healthcare protocols rather than symptomatic treatment. Health system strengthening will happen at three levels: (i) assess clinics using the standardized scorecard and assist factories to upgrade clinics with required basic infrastructure, point of care diagnostics, and SOPs, (ii) train doctors, nurses, and health assistants on primary health care treatment and preventive aspects such as; Malnutrition, Anaemia, Menstrual Health Management, Reproductive Health, and healthy lifestyle, etc. (iii) provide hand-holding and quality assurance support to clinic teams. 



The program also enables workers to avail of family planning and reproductive health services which include the provision of education, counseling, etc. 

1.2 Preventive Health Education and Promotion:

Health@Work will enhance workers' knowledge and skills as ‘first responders’ or Wellness Facilitators (WFs) to promote healthy practices and behaviors among workers (e.g. use of water filters, hygiene practices, sanitary napkins, etc.) and at workplaces through promotional activities. A cohort of workers from each factory will be trained on health topics and skills to deliver preventive health education among workers in their respective batches. Apart from WFs, Nurses, Welfare Officers, and Health and Safety Officers will be trained to provide health education to workers. 

1.2.a.Special Focus on Mental Health: The program will provide counseling services to address mental health issues of workers in factories aimed at helping workers overcome fear, anxiety, stress, low self-esteem, conflicts, career growth challenges, etc. Cases that require a higher level of counseling support will be referred to local facilities that offer professional counseling and specialized mental health care and treatment. 

        1.3 Maternal and Child Care System Strengthening : ( Both countries special focus on  Indonesia ) 

1.3.a Create Enabling Spaces for Women and Children - Swasti will work with factory management and ensure the breastfeeding rooms and childcare facilities are upgraded according to the regulatory requirements. Ensure safe and quality infrastructures are present in the factory for women to access. The childcare unit staff will be trained on WASH. Emergency signs among children and early education. 

1.3.b Education on Child Care and Parenting - The Wellness facilitators and the clinic team will be trained on exclusive breastfeeding - benefits, process of expression, and safe storage of milk. A special focus on complementary feeding, and the importance of WASH practices will be implied. Guiedne of childhood illness (   Support groups will be established creating safe spaces for parents ( Both mother and father) to understand and clarify their doubts. 

1.4 Workplace Commuting Safety - ( Specific to Vietnam ) - 

   1.4.A - Commuting Safety Commitee - Swasti will be working with the factory to establish clear commuting guidelines for both the workers and the factory's transport facilities. It's important to prioritize the safety and well-being of the workers during their commute to and from work. A committee with designated roles and responsibilities will be established to  ensure that the guidelines are effectively implemented and followed. The committee would meet regularly to understand and monitor the progress. 

      1.4.b - Outreach - Regular outreach sessions on road traffic safety, safe driving measures, rules, and regulations will be conducted by the committee members on the factory floors. This will help to create awareness among workers about the potential risks of road accidents and how they can be prevented. Posters on RTA implications and safe driving measures will be printed and pasted on the high-visibility areas within the factory.  Audio-visuals / Jingles can be played at regular intervals using the Public Address system of the factory.

     1.4C. Clinic Team Engagement -The factory clinic team will be trained to handle reported RTAs and emergency referrals will be made to the nearest hospitals. These steps can help ensure a safe and healthy work environment for employees. 



Package II - Promotion of Workplace Relationships and Life Skills: 

This strategy aims to build positive work relationships between employees and Supervisors/Managers through training and counseling. The program team will deliver worker and manager training aimed at improving relationships, worker confidence, career growth opportunities, reductions in harassment, and gender equality. Swasti will engage with management at different levels to support the creation of a respectful work environment for the workers.

2.1 Supervisor & Management Training: 

Capacity building for supervisors and managers to enhance empathy, increase understanding of worker issues, support workers to overcome challenges, and reduce conflicts with a special focus on the women workforce in the center of the lens. The duration of this training will be around 15-20 hours.

2.2 Worker Life Skills Training: 

Swasti will train workers on life skills which aims to enhance workers’ life skills and workplace excellence skills which are required for them to demonstrate their performance. The 15 to 20-hour training will cover the following content: communication, work-life balance, work relationships, quality of work, workplace discipline, and workers’ participation in factory growth.

The training will be delivered through a Training of Trainers (ToT) model by which Swasti will develop a set of Trainers from within the factory. These trainers will have a required set of knowledge and skills to train workers on basic life skills. Swasti will provide handholding support for trainers to conduct the training in the respective factories. ToT consists of 6 days of training followed by 2 days of refresher training. These trainings are residential and organized centrally for all the factory trainers.

The Curriculum: Swasti will use a tried and tested life skills curriculum to train workers and supervisors. This training curriculum has been shown to reduce late days from 45 per month to 17, increase productivity by 5 percent, reduce turnover, and pay for itself in less than 1.7 months.  





Package III - Financial Inclusion and Social Protection: 



One of the key focuses of the Health@Work  model is to reduce economic vulnerabilities among workers. This will be done through the establishment of a Unified Help Desk (UHD) in the factory. The UHD will serve as a centralized source of information and navigation point for workers to avail social protection schemes and entitlements such as; housing schemes, scholarships for children's education, pensions, saving schemes, etc. Linkages will be established with financial and social protection services providers.



The UHD will drive worker wellbeing by:  

Providing financial literacy to workers on budgeting, saving, responsible borrowing, etc. for better financial management and access to financial products. This training will sensitize workers to the risks of investing in informal sources like chit funds.

Building capacities of key staff as help desk facilitators through workshops on social protection/financial inclusion

Enabling workers to avail social protection schemes and entitlements through the Unified Help Desk (UHD) established in factories.

Conducting fairs or ‘melas’ in the factory to build workers’ awareness and access to financial/ social protection products and services, while they are at work.



The process for accessing Social Protection Schemes and Entitlements: 

The Unified Help Desk acts as a single-window approach to provide awareness and facilitate access to social protection schemes and services.

Workers will approach the Unified Help Desk to gather information on social protection schemes and services that are relevant to them.

The Help Desk facilitator will provide information on schemes and services, and the eligibility criteria to access them.

Workers will arrange the documents required to access the schemes.

Once the documents have been arranged, workers will be assisted to fill in the requisite forms and log in to the application for the relevant scheme with the help desk.

The Help Desk facilitator will encourage workers to submit the applications to the respective government departments and enable them to do the follow-up. 



Implementation of the Program

The program will be rolled out in several steps including

  Establishing multi-stakeholder collaboration

Stakeholder Workshops to orient brands, industry leaders, industry associations, government departments, etc. 

 Enroll factories by signing a memorandum of understanding



Roll out at the Factory Level - 

 Kick-off workshop at the factory - During the kick off workshop, the programs, goal and objectives will be oriented to the senior leadership and the mid-management of the factory . This exercise ensures all the leadership are aligned towards the intervention in the factory setup. 

Baseline Assessment - The baseline assessment will be conducted to understand the current needs of the workers and  factory. Swasti  will technically guide the factory team to administer the questionnaire. n addition to the baseline conducted by the factories, Swasti will also plan separate interviews with selected management representatives based on need and  conduct  two focus group discussions with approximately 10 to 12 workers representing both genders. The baseline tool and the FGD tool will be used again at the end of the program implementation cycle to measure impact and outcomes.

Vision-building workshop with factory leadership and development of a work plan - This workshop enables the leadership to establish a clear vision towards the worker wellbeing in their factory- By the end of the workshop, a clear action plan will be roled out with the  core team comprising department and unit heads including HR, production, operation, and others, with cluster coordinators 

Orientation for supervisors and mid-management - A two to three-hour orientation will be conducted for the immediate and mid managers about the program and their contribution to the initiative. This would help to create an enabling environment and ensure that they also become partners for change in achieving health among workers. Supervisors, mid managers, production team, factory nurse, GM, VF representatives and Swasti team will be part of this event. Health system strengthening;

 Clinic Assessment: The factory clinic will be assessed using a clinic assessment tool, that is part of the baseline tool. It would help to assess the role of the health staff, services provided in the clinic, health issues of workers, treatment, maintenance of data, clinic equipment and follow up and referrals to service providers. Swasti will analyse the data and provide support to the factory to upgrade the clinic based on the outcome of the assessment.



Health System Strengthening- Swasti will provide in-person intensive training to the clinic team on screening for 4 health conditions - Anemia, Diabetes, Hypertension and Vision. Swasti will enable the clinic team to procure the point-of-care diagnostics to conduct screening at the factory. The factory team will be equipped with all the necessary protocols. The clinic team will also be supported in mapping the nearest hospitals and linkages for early referrals.



Capacity building of Wellness Facilitators (WFs): Swasti will build the capacity of HFs (Nurse, Doctors and Welfare Officer) on primary health care for delivery of improved health services and ensuring dissemination of health information to the workforce through Peer Educators (PEs). The health facilitators will undergo training on facilitation skills, behavior change and health topics such as Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WaSH), Nutrition and Anemia, and  other relevant themes that will be prioritized.



Develop Peer Educators: Workers from different batches and departments will be selected as Peer Educators. The Health Facilitators will train the Peer Educators and ensure that they disseminate health information to the workers on the floor.



Enhance knowledge among female workers on Anemia, Menstrual Health and Hygiene and improve access to menstrual health products: The trained Peer Educators will ensure that awareness on Nutrition and Anemia reaches all workers across the factory. Reinforcement of learning will be done using audiovisual aids (videos, audio clips, posters, flip charts) and individual and group interactions. The Peer Educators will ensure that workers practice and adopt behavior change until it becomes a habit for sustained impact towards health.. Their capacities will be built to facilitate access to health products and services through networks and linkages with service providers. 









The program will be implemented over 3 years.  Starting with the health package in year 1 and slowly moving into the other packages, whilst the Health intervention is fully strengthened and made sustainable and has been set in autopilot mode with all the protocols, systems, and processes in place. 



Monitoring and Evaluation 

As a part of the program, there will be a robust Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEAL) through (1) quarterly reflections with the implementation team to identify and address issues; (2) factory-level review meetings to review progress and address challenges; (3) cross-learning workshops; (4) distribution of key materials- video manual, videos, and case studies.","worker wellbeing, countries occupational, indonesia garment, women sector, sanitation safety"
Copy of Torsion ovary_testis.pdf,,"
Testicular Torsion
● Definition : sudden Rotation of the testicle, specifically the spermatic cord around its 
axis in the inguinal canal or below. 
● The acute rotation results in compromised blood flow to and from the testicle, which 
puts the testicle at risk for necrosis
● Quick diagnosis and intervention is key to saving the affected testicle. Emergent 
surgical exploration with subsequent orchidopexy is required. Ultrasound or manual 
detorsion should not delay definitive care.

Clinical Presentation: 
 ● Acute-onset, severe, constant testicular or scrotal Pain 
● Associated Nausea and vomiting 
● history of strenuous activity or trauma reported
● Children may awaken at night with scrotal pain from cremasteric contraction.
● Hard scrotal mass

Twist Score
Clinical findings:
● Physical exam: 
○ Edematous, tender, indurated testicle/scrotum
○ Affected testicle lies horizontally.
○ High-riding testicle due to spermatic cord shortening
● Key physical exam maneuvers: 
○ Cremasteric reflex : (elevation of testicle when stroking upper inner thigh) is 
usually absent.
○ Prehn sign: Lifting the scrotum relieves pain in Epididymitis  and increases Pain  in 
torsion. 
● Scrotal ultrasound: 
○ Should not delay definitive management 
○ Color Doppler will demonstrate decreased testicular vascular perfusion.


Treatment
● Time is essential in testicle preservation:
○ Within 4–6 hours: 95% viability
○ After 12 hours: 20%–60% viability
○ After 24 hours: 0%–20% viability
Emergency surgical exploration of the affected testicle with reduction (untwisting) and bilateral orchidopexy 
(fixation of testicle to scrotal wall) 


        Ovarian torsion
Rotation of the ovary and portion of the fallopian tube on the supplying vascular 
pedicle leading to reduced venous return, stromal edema, internal hemorrhage, 
and infarction with the subsequent complications
causes:
1. Hypermobility of the ovary: <50%
2. Adnexal mass: ~50-80%
○ most lesions are dermoid cysts 
○ large cystic ovaries undergoing ovarian hyperstimulation are at particular risk
○ masses between 5-10 cm are at most risk 

Ovarian torsion

Clinical features:
 ● severe, unilateral lower abdominal pain that worsens intermittently 
over many hours
●  often radiating to the back, pelvis, or thigh
● Nausea and vomiting

Context of Indonesia -.docx,,"INDONESIA COUNTRY PROFILE 



With a population 237 million population Indonesia’s textile and garment sector is one of the largest in the world, employs millions of local people and is a major driver of economic growth in the country. The sector accounted for 6.1% of Indonesia’s manufacturing sector GDP in 2021 or 1.1% of total GDP, worth USD 12.3 billion. The industries aid 5.2 million workers  with 80% women workforce. In 2022, over 87 percent of Indonesians declared themselves to be Muslim, followed by 7.43 percent who were Christians. The legal working age is 15 years. However, children in the ages between 15 to 17 are to be carefully trained and monitored not allowing them to handle hazardous jobs in the factory . The labour law guidelines suggest that these children are not allowed to do overtime or work between 6:00pm to 6:00 am. When children under 18 work, the employer must sign an employment agreement with a parent or guardian.  The work timings of the country is  40 hours per week with 1 or 2 days off  based on the no.of works hours  No more than 7 hours per day for 6 regular working days per week regular or 8 hours per days with 2 days off per weekl 





Problem Statement - 



The top 10 most common causes of death are Ischemic Heart Disease, Diabetes, cirrosis liver, tuberclosis and COPD, diarheal diseases  hypertensive heart disease, lung cancer , and lower respiratory infections. The risk factor include high blood pressure, tobacco usage, high fasting blood glucose, and high body mass index



ANEMIA 

Accorinding to the world nutrition journal the prevalence of anemia as high as 48.9% in pregnant women and 38.5% in children under 5 years old. It is even higher among adolescents aged 12-18 years, especially in rural areas. In a  recent study published in 2021 the prevalence of anemia among female 24.6% as compared to 7.4% in male  among garment workers . 





Maternal And Child Health - 

The maternal mortality rate in Indonesia is 177 per 100,000 per live births.1–5.The reasons for high MMR is , following of many myths such as restriction towards nutritional rich including  include restrictions on the quantity and quality of food consumed by pregnant women.1,18,39 For example, protein-rich foods are rarely given to pregnant women. Many women also restrict accessing medical facilty and approach shamans for health care needs .  In fact, the conceptual framework of The United Nations Children’s Fund Food-Care Health indicated that cultural beliefs and practices related to food during pregnancy are one of the fundamental causes of maternal malnutrition that will have an impact on the health and fitness of pregnant women and quality of fetal growth and development even after birth. On the other hand self-medication carried out by pregnant women and their families without being accompanied by competent health workers will increase maternal complications.

Malaria in pregnancy is strongly associated with still births, low birth weight, infant mortality and a reduced potential for child development.  Eastern Indonesia has the highest malaria prevalence in the country. 

Stunting in Children - 

World Bank study on stunting found that around one-third of children under ϐive in Indonesia were stunted (low height for their age), which was one of the highest rates in the world. This was especially alarming as stunting is considered to be a reliable indicator of chronic malnutrition which in turn often affects brain development in early childhood.

BreastFeeding - Breastfeeding rates are sharply declining in Indonesia. The percentage of children breastfed during the first hour of birth has dropped to 48.6% in 2021 from 58.2% from 2018 . Similar the exclusive breastfeeding rates for the first 6 months had declined to 55.2% from 64.5% from 2018 to 2021. 



Musculoskeletal Disorders - The prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in Indonesia in 2020 based on diagnoses made by health workers is 11.9% and based on diagnosis or symptoms is 24.7%.The significant risk factors for MSDs include increasing age, female gender, increased work duration, poor knowledge of ergonomics, wrong work posture, non-ergonomic support facilities, lack of physical activity, as well as poor psychosocial conditions in the workplace. Work posture is one of the factors that can influence the emergence of MSDs complaints in workers because while doing work, this factor will continuously expose workers. Muscles that are used to continue working can become tired, the muscles are unable to continue working or the muscle's ability to produce maximum force is reduced. 

Vision - The untreated refractory error is the leading cause of blindess in Indonesia contributing to the prevalence of 3% . the major contributing causes for bilateral low vision were cataract (61.3%), uncorrected refractive error (12.9%), and amblyopia (12.9%), and the major cause of bilateral blindness was cataract (62.5%). The major causes of unilateral low vision were cataract (48.0%) and uncorrected refractive error (12.0%), and major causes of unilateral blindness were amblyopia (50.0%) and trauma (50.0%). The untreated refractory errors are a ;leading cause of blindness among children. And this prevalence is seemingly high among the urban population compared to the rural population. On the other hand the prevalence of refractory error post pandamic has increased among children ( between 9 to 15 years ) . 





 

 HIV - Indonesia has an overall HIV prevalence of approximately 0.3% and annual incidence of 46,659 (2018), 50,282 (2019), and 41,397 (2020).2,1HIV prevalence in Indonesia is increasing, and only 64% of infected individuals know their status.Women represent over 35% of new infections per year and of the total (640,000) in Indonesia. Over 50% of HIV diagnoses are made when patients already have AIDS. Stigma and discrimination are still strong barriers in prevention and treatment but also there are considerable challenges in access to appropriate anti-retroviral therapy. Major causes of HIV vulnerability of Female Garment Workerss are poverty (low wages), gender inequality, drug abuse, multiple sex partners, lack of knowledge on STIs/HIV, low use of condoms, and rape violence found in selected LMIC.

Mental Health - An estimated 11% of the Indonesian population suffers from  mental health disorder. The actual number may be much higher. However, less than 1% of the country’s healthcare budget is dedicated to mental health services.long working hours, the monotony of the type of work, work-related injury, feeling unsafe in the workplace, and lack of recognition have been identified as the major causes of psychological health vulnerabilities among the RMG workers [22].There’s only one mental health hospital per every 5 million people. Nearly all psychiatrists are located in urban centers. Due to the severe shortage of community-based mental health services and other support for people with psychosocial disabilities and their families, families resort to shackling their relatives with these disabilities. Mental health is still stigmatized in the communites . 

Diabetes and Hypertension -  According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), Indonesia's national diabetes prevalence is estimated to be 6.2% in 2019 and 10.8% in 2021, placing it among the top 10 countries with the highest prevalence of T2DM and also with the steepest climb.1Hypertension is a risk factor for heart disease and stroke that is responsible for at least 45% of heart disease mortality, and 51% of stroke mortality (1). The Indonesian Basic Health Research in 2018 reported that the prevalence of hypertension in Indonesia was 34.1% of the total adult population, 

Health System at Factoy - Pre-employment medical examinations are conducted to ensure that workers are physically and mentally fit for their jobs and are not suffering from any contagious diseases that could affect other workers. Periodic medical examinations are performed at least once a year. Special Medical examinations are provided to certain categories of workers performing specific types of work with certain health risks. They are also provided to workers with complaints about a particular health probl em. Employers are regulated  conduct risk assessments, develop policies, and educate workers on HIV/AIDS prevention and control. Employers must provide healthcare for people with HIV/AIDS.

It can be influenced by the belief of ancestors who forbid modern health services and even prevented them from going to health facilities for pregnancy check-ups.45 Self-medication carried out by pregnant women and their families without being accompanied by competent health workers will increase maternal complications.

Malaria in pregnancy is strongly associated with still births, low birth weight, infant mortality and a reduced potential for child development.  Eastern Indonesia has the highest malaria prevalence in the country. 



breastfeeding can be a miasma. Only about 15% of Indonesian women breastfeed their infants, according to government estimates

Stunting among children

a World Bank study on stunting found that around one-third of children under ϐive in Indonesia were stunted (low height for their age), which was one of the highest rates in the world . This was especially alarming as stunting is considered to be a reliable indicator of chronic malnutrition which in turn often affects brain development in early childhood.

Muskuloskeletal Problems - The prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in Indonesia in 2020 based on diagnoses made by health workers is 11.9% and based on diagnosis or symptoms is 24.7%. Preventing the MSDs can help reduce absenteeism, and early retirement, improve productivity, and promote safety at the workplace

The significant risk factors for MSDs include increasing age, female gender, increased work duration, poor knowledge of ergonomics, wrong work posture, non-ergonomic support facilities, lack of physical activity, as well as poor psychosocial conditions in the workplace.

The research results show that there is a relationship between work posture and complaints of musculoskeletal disorders. Work posture or attitude is an action taken by a worker when doing work. This is in line with the theory that work posture is one of the factors that can influence the emergence of MSDs complaints in workers because while doing work, this factor will continuously expose workers. Muscles that are used to continue working can become tired, the muscles are unable to continue working or the muscle's ability to produce maximum force is reduced. 

Vision- 



The prevalence of blindness in Indonesia in 3%. the major contributing causes for bilateral low vision were cataract (61.3%), uncorrected refractive error (12.9%), and amblyopia (12.9%), and the major cause of bilateral blindness was cataract (62.5%).

 The major causes of unilateral low vision were cataract (48.0%) and uncorrected refractive error (12.0%), and major causes of unilateral blindness were amblyopia (50.0%) and trauma (50.0%).

The untreated refractory errors are a ;leading cause of blindness among children. And this prevalence is seemingly high among the urban population compared to the rural population. On the other hand the prevalence of refractory error post pandamic has increased among children ( between 9 to 15 years ) . 





SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH - Indonesia has an overall HIV prevalence of approximately 0.3% and annual incidence of 46,659 (2018), 50,282 (2019), and 41,397 (2020).2,1HIV prevalence in Indonesia is increasing, and only 64% of infected individuals know their status.Women represent over 35% of new infections per year and of the total (640,000) in Indonesia. Over 50% of HIV diagnoses are made when patients already have AIDS. Stigma and discrimination are still strong barriers in prevention and treatment but also there are considerable challenges in access to appropriate anti-retroviral therapy. Major causes of HIV vulnerability of FGWs are poverty (low wages), gender inequality, drug abuse, multiple sex partners, lack of knowledge on STIs/HIV, low use of condoms, and rape violence found in selected LMIC.





Status of health system (factory, public and private etc)



The health systems is categorized into Public and Private 





Public  Healthcare - Managed by the Ministry of Health. Has Goverment run secoundary and teritiary hospitals, community health centers ( Pukesmas ) and Public health programs 



Healthcare is decentralized managed by central, provincial and district governments



For the most part, public health facilities in Indonesia are modest. Major cities like Jakarta have good public hospitals but rural clinics offer very limited resources. Additionally, most public facilities are in dire need of investment for modern equipment, laboratory services, and staffing capabilities.

Private facilities, in contrast, are clean, well organized, and up to date. A much higher percentage of the staff speak English compared to public centers. As well, wait times are much shorter and there’s a good range of specialists available. Patients can expect to receive care in a comfortable, private environment.



Mental Health - 



 The common symptoms of psychological issues identified in the literature include trauma [4, 30], work stress [31], depression and its associated risk factors such as insomnia, hypertension, and heart attack [8, 25], somatic illness, anxiety and social dysfunction [8], and sleeplessness [10]. The causes of work stress, which mainly fuels psychological vulnerabilities, are primarily related to work associated demands (i.e. long working hours, worries about mistakes, time pressure, exposure to abusive language and emotional abuse, and physical demand) [10, 31] and work-related values (i.e. lack of freedom at work, lack of job promotion prospects, part-time work and job insecurity) [10, 25, 31]. In addition, long working hours, the monotony of the type of work, work-related injury, feeling unsafe in the workplace, and lack of recognition have been identified as the major causes of psychological health vulnerabilities among the RMG workers [22]. 



, Rubin et al. (2015) found that workers in Vietnamese apparel factories who report

verbal and  physical abuse  by supervisors  exhibit  higher  indicators  of poor mental  health,

including a sense of hopelessness about the future. Asense of hopelessness is a negative predictor

of productivity and wages (controlling for productivity and demographic characteristics). That

is, workers who are the victims of verbal and physical abuse feel hopeless about the future, are

less productive and receive lower pay (after controlling for the negative effect of verbal abuse

on productivity).





Pasung is the practice of shackling and confining people with mental health conditions at home because of the misconception that they are physically aggressive or dangerous. Some people believe it is because they are possessed by demons. They are forced by their families and society to stay in isolated rooms, bound with chains and wooden beams, all day long and all year round. They eat, drink, urinate and defecate in place. It is still a common practice in Indonesia. 



The mental Health Act was passed in the year 2014 



There’s only one mental health hospital per every 5 million people. Nearly all psychiatrists are located in urban centers. 

Indonesia has only 48 mental health institutions and about 600 to 800 psychiatrists. More than half of the psychiatric hospitals are in four of the country’s 34 provinces, while eight provinces have no psychiatric hospitals at all. Due to the severe shortage of community-based mental health services and other support for people with psychosocial disabilities and their families, families resort to shackling their relatives with these disabilities. Mental health is still stigmatized in the communites 



At Factory - 

Employers should arrange for pre-employment, periodic and special medical checks at no cost to workers by a certified Industrial Hygiene, Ergonomics, Occupational Safety and Health (HIPERKES) doctor.

Pre-employment medical examinations are conducted to ensure that workers are physically and mentally fit for their jobs and are not suffering from any contagious diseases that could affect other workers.

Periodic medical examinations are performed at least once a year.

Special Medical examinations are provided to certain categories of workers performing specific types of work with certain health risks. They are also provided to workers with complaints about a particular health problem.

Employers must conduct risk assessments, develop policies, and educate workers on HIV/AIDS prevention and control. Employers must provide healthcare for people with HIV/AIDS.

Health Policies and Health security schemes 





1National Health Insurance (Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional [JKN]) scheme.Under the JKN program, Indonesians receive coverage from public healthcare providers and private facilities that opt to join the system. Those people who hold traditional employment will pay an insurance premium worth 5% of their salary. 1% is paid by the employee and 4% is paid by the employer.



The programme provides comprehensive coverage of treatment for most outpatient and inpatient visits in public and enlisted private facilities. For maternal health services, JKN covers antenatal, delivery, and postnatal care, as well as referral services at secondary and tertiary hospitals [20]. Despite the introduction of JKN, the burden of out-of-pocket expenditure on health stood at 40% in 2018 [21], with the insured still incurring high OOPE



JKN has not closed the gap of access to services within regions, in particular in Eastern Indonesia, where the availability of human resources for health and facilities is still much lower compared to other regions [16,20,43].

 Poor supply-side readiness and inadequate quality of care remain important challenges in Indonesia [9,12,45-47]. The referral system is still lacking, resulting in delays in service provision. Necessary supplies and equipment, such as blood transfusion, may not always be available [47]. These challenges are particularly evident in East Kalimantan, a province with the highest rates of facility-based delivery and SBA in Kalimantan but persistently high MMR [46].The 2016 Indonesia Quantitative Service Delivery Survey revealed that the ability of health providers to deliver ANC, identify risk of complications, and manage complications according to guidelines is still weak [9]



2. The Indonesian National Health Development Program is based on a primary health care concept: the community health center is the basic health care facility, supported by hospitals and other community-based health care facilities



3. Healthy Productive women workers Movement - aims to support the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It is expected to increase the participation of governments and companies as well as explore the potential that exists in the community in addressing the health and nutrition needs of female workers. This program must be implemented in factories to improve the health and quality of life of female workers.

Indonesia’s social protection system consists of contributory schemes (health insurance3 and employment insurance programs). Non-contributory schemes



Major non-contributory schemes include food assistance programs (Rastra4 and Bantuan Pangan Non Tunai – BPNT), conditional cash transfers (Program Keluarga Harapan – PKH) and a cash transfer for students from poor and vulnerable families (Program Indonesia Pintar – PIP).

COVID -19 HEALTH INSURANCE POLICY
Taking note of the emerging needs Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority in India (IRDAI) had issued a circular asking the insurance providers to come up with health insurance plans to offer protective coverage for expenses related to the coronavirus disease.

specially designed coronavirus health insurance plan covers the hefty expenses associated with the treatment of this highly infectious disease. A COVID-19 health insurance policy covers for various in-patient hospitalisation expenses, pre-hospitalisation and post-hospitalisation expenses, focusing  entirely on quick recovery. 

Note that COVID-19 health insurance policy do not cover during the isolation period when the treatment is not required.
Corona Kavach Policy for COVID 19


Is a single premium standard health insurance policy that covers treatment expenses related to COVID-19. 

It is an indemnity-based health insurance policy that covers both individuals as well as families at an affordable premium. 

You can cover self, dependent children, parents, and parents in law under this policy for a period of 3.5 months (105 days), 6.5 months (195 days), and 9.5 months (285 days). 

Offered by both private and general insurers, the policy offers cover against AYUSH treatment expenses, homecare treatment expenses, pre-hospitalisation expenses, post-hospitalisation expenses, and road ambulance expenses. 

The best thing about the policy is that it comes with a short waiting period of 15 days, which means that you can start availing of policy benefits soon. Also, you can opt for a daily cash benefit by paying an extra premium.
Types of Coronavirus Health Insurance Policy in India
Corona Rakshak Policy for COVID 19

is a standard health insurance policy especially designed to cover treatment expenses related to.
 Unlike Corona Kavach Policy, it is a benefit based health insurance policy that pays the insured a lump sum benefit equal to 100% of the sum insured if he/she is tested positive for COVID-19. 
The policy offers coverage on an individual basis for sum insured options ranging between Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 2.5 lakh in the multiples of Rs. 50,000. 
The policy can be purchased by people aged between 18 years and 65 years. 
Available for short policy terms of 3.5 months, 6.5 months, and 9.5 months, the policy gets terminated upon the payment of benefit. But the insured can avail of policy benefits only he/she is tested COVID-19 positive at a government recognised center and gets hospitalised for at least 72 hours continuously.
 The policy comes with a short waiting period of 15 days but does not offer lifetime renewability benefit, it being a benefits based policy.
Getting Covered Under Corona Medical Insurance alongside a Basic Health Insurance Policy

If one already has a health insurance policy that protects from expenses incurred on room rent in case of hospitalisation, then they must go for Corona Rakshak Policy. If not already have a health insurance policy, then you can buy Corona Kavach Policy as it protects you against room rent and other expenses.

In case there are the sole earner in family, then buying a Corona Rakshak Policy is recommended

One may also purchase Corona Kavach Policy if already have a health insurance cover. But the claim settlement may differ with different policies laid out.

COVID -19 HEALTH INSURANCE POLICY
Taking note of the emerging needs Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority in India (IRDAI) had issued a circular asking the insurance providers to come up with health insurance plans to offer protective coverage for expenses related to the coronavirus disease.

specially designed coronavirus health insurance plan covers the hefty expenses associated with the treatment of this highly infectious disease. A COVID-19 health insurance policy covers for various in-patient hospitalisation expenses, pre-hospitalisation and post-hospitalisation expenses, focusing  entirely on quick recovery. 

Note that COVID-19 health insurance policy do not cover during the isolation period when the treatment is not required.
Corona Kavach Policy for COVID 19


Is a single premium standard health insurance policy that covers treatment expenses related to COVID-19. 

It is an indemnity-based health insurance policy that covers both individuals as well as families at an affordable premium. 

You can cover self, dependent children, parents, and parents in law under this policy for a period of 3.5 months (105 days), 6.5 months (195 days), and 9.5 months (285 days). 

Offered by both private and general insurers, the policy offers cover against AYUSH treatment expenses, homecare treatment expenses, pre-hospitalisation expenses, post-hospitalisation expenses, and road ambulance expenses. 

The best thing about the policy is that it comes with a short waiting period of 15 days, which means that you can start availing of policy benefits soon. Also, you can opt for a daily cash benefit by paying an extra premium.
Types of Coronavirus Health Insurance Policy in India
Corona Rakshak Policy for COVID 19

is a standard health insurance policy especially designed to cover treatment expenses related to.
 Unlike Corona Kavach Policy, it is a benefit based health insurance policy that pays the insured a lump sum benefit equal to 100% of the sum insured if he/she is tested positive for COVID-19. 
The policy offers coverage on an individual basis for sum insured options ranging between Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 2.5 lakh in the multiples of Rs. 50,000. 
The policy can be purchased by people aged between 18 years and 65 years. 
Available for short policy terms of 3.5 months, 6.5 months, and 9.5 months, the policy gets terminated upon the payment of benefit. But the insured can avail of policy benefits only he/she is tested COVID-19 positive at a government recognised center and gets hospitalised for at least 72 hours continuously.
 The policy comes with a short waiting period of 15 days but does not offer lifetime renewability benefit, it being a benefits based policy.
Getting Covered Under Corona Medical Insurance alongside a Basic Health Insurance Policy

If one already has a health insurance policy that protects from expenses incurred on room rent in case of hospitalisation, then they must go for Corona Rakshak Policy. If not already have a health insurance policy, then you can buy Corona Kavach Policy as it protects you against room rent and other expenses.

In case there are the sole earner in family, then buying a Corona Rakshak Policy is recommended

One may also purchase Corona Kavach Policy if already have a health insurance cover. But the claim settlement may differ with different policies laid out.

COVID -19 HEALTH INSURANCE POLICY
Taking note of the emerging needs Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority in India (IRDAI) had issued a circular asking the insurance providers to come up with health insurance plans to offer protective coverage for expenses related to the coronavirus disease.

specially designed coronavirus health insurance plan covers the hefty expenses associated with the treatment of this highly infectious disease. A COVID-19 health insurance policy covers for various in-patient hospitalisation expenses, pre-hospitalisation and post-hospitalisation expenses, focusing  entirely on quick recovery. 

Note that COVID-19 health insurance policy do not cover during the isolation period when the treatment is not required.
Corona Kavach Policy for COVID 19


Is a single premium standard health insurance policy that covers treatment expenses related to COVID-19. 

It is an indemnity-based health insurance policy that covers both individuals as well as families at an affordable premium. 

You can cover self, dependent children, parents, and parents in law under this policy for a period of 3.5 months (105 days), 6.5 months (195 days), and 9.5 months (285 days). 

Offered by both private and general insurers, the policy offers cover against AYUSH treatment expenses, homecare treatment expenses, pre-hospitalisation expenses, post-hospitalisation expenses, and road ambulance expenses. 

The best thing about the policy is that it comes with a short waiting period of 15 days, which means that you can start availing of policy benefits soon. Also, you can opt for a daily cash benefit by paying an extra premium.
Types of Coronavirus Health Insurance Policy in India
Corona Rakshak Policy for COVID 19

is a standard health insurance policy especially designed to cover treatment expenses related to.
 Unlike Corona Kavach Policy, it is a benefit based health insurance policy that pays the insured a lump sum benefit equal to 100% of the sum insured if he/she is tested positive for COVID-19. 
The policy offers coverage on an individual basis for sum insured options ranging between Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 2.5 lakh in the multiples of Rs. 50,000. 
The policy can be purchased by people aged between 18 years and 65 years. 
Available for short policy terms of 3.5 months, 6.5 months, and 9.5 months, the policy gets terminated upon the payment of benefit. But the insured can avail of policy benefits only he/she is tested COVID-19 positive at a government recognised center and gets hospitalised for at least 72 hours continuously.
 The policy comes with a short waiting period of 15 days but does not offer lifetime renewability benefit, it being a benefits based policy.
Getting Covered Under Corona Medical Insurance alongside a Basic Health Insurance Policy

If one already has a health insurance policy that protects from expenses incurred on room rent in case of hospitalisation, then they must go for Corona Rakshak Policy. If not already have a health insurance policy, then you can buy Corona Kavach Policy as it protects you against room rent and other expenses.

In case there are the sole earner in family, then buying a Corona Rakshak Policy is recommended

One may also purchase Corona Kavach Policy if already have a health insurance cover. But the claim settlement may differ with different policies laid out.

Vaccines teach our body how to recognize and fight the infection before it happens
Source: https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/how-do-vaccines-work
What are vaccines and how do they work?
‹#›
What COVID vaccines are available in India?
Two vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin manufactured have been licensed for emergency use in India
   
Emergency Use Authorization is a process that helps facilitate the availability and use of medicines and vaccines during public health emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19 vaccines are being held to the same safety standards as all vaccines.
‹#›
Key features of the two COVID vaccines


‹#›
What to expect after taking the vaccine?
Very rare serious side effect:
Anaphylactic shock/ serious allergic reaction: Happens immediately after taking the vaccine. Individuals are asked to wait at the vaccine site for 30 mins and centers are equipped to handle this

If any other reactions such as serious rashes, breathing issues, allergies are observed individuals should report to the vaccine center immediately or contact the number provided
These should resolve in 2-3 days after taking the vaccine. 

Paracetamol/dolo/crocin may be used to address side effects 

These symptoms indicate that the body is learning how to fight the infection and are a good sign of immune response generation

‹#›
Why do we get symptoms after taking a vaccine?
Play WHO video by clicking on  above picture
To read more click here.


Who is the vaccine contraindicated for?
If you are pregnant or might be pregnant (pregnant women not included in studies/trials)
If you are allergic to any products in the vaccine
If you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to any pharmaceutical products   or medications, or previous anaphylactic shocks from other vaccines 
If you are currently feeling sick or have COVID right now wait atleast 30 days after you feel better to take the vaccine 
Vaccine is not advisable for extremely sick or hospitalized individuals currently
The vaccine is not available for children (children were not included in the studies/trials but these trials are ongoing)

If your sugar or BP is not controlled: 
Its advisable to take medication to control these vitals before taking the vaccine.
Vaccine should not be taken if:
Who is eligible to get the vaccines in India right now and why?
Front line workers such as health, sanitation and civil defense staff
     These individuals are the most exposed to the virus and are at high risk of infection. (In Phase 1)

Individuals over 45 years of age 
     Senior citizens are at higher risk of serious infection, hospitalization and death 
     due to COVID-19 infection compared to young     (In second phase)

All individuals above the age of 18+

The following individuals are eligible to get the vaccine in India:
What comorbidities put you at risk of severe disease from COVID-19?
Anyone with following types of issues, it is highly recommended for them to take the vaccine to protect themselves(GoI guidelines):

Heart conditions
Cancer
Immunodeficiency like HIV or is on high dose steroids to suppress immune system
liver problems and cirrhosis
Kidney failure
Diabetes/Sugar 
Hypertension
Severe disabilities (that make you dependent on others for care and therefore increase exposure)
How much time does it take for vaccines to start working?
A robust immune response only develops 2-3 weeks after THE SECOND DOSE of the vaccine. 

Currently timing of second dose depends on the type of vaccine taken:

COVISHIELD:  12 -16 Weeks / 84 days (revised recently)

COVAXIN: 4-6 Weeks / 28-42 days(remains same as previous guidance)

People must continue to wear masks and social distance because:
Vaccine is not 100% effective
You might still transmit disease to others around you even if you are protected
How can people access vaccines?
Register yourself on Co-WIN website using a photo ID if you are eligible as per current government guidelines 
It is a website and not an App.

What are some Key messages that should be given to people while talking to them about COVID-19 vaccines?
ALWAYS END WITH WHERE PEOPLE CAN TAKE THE VACCINE AND NEXT STEPS
 
Take the vaccine at XX location near you 
Ensure you carry your original photo ID 
Register yourself on Co-WIN using your ID
What are some Key messages that should be given to people while talking to them about COVID-19 vaccines?
IS THE VACCINE 100% SAFE?
No medicine or vaccine is 100% safe. Even the polio vaccine that has been around for decades has rare side effects. There is a very small possibility of  rare serious side effects but the vaccines have been rigorously tested and are safe for majority of the population. The risk of serious disease from COVID-19 is much higher, especially for those over 45 and those with co-morbidities so it is important to take the vaccine. It is safe for those with co-morbidities to take the vaccine.
HOW EFFECTIVE IS THE VACCINE IN PROTECTING ME?

The vaccines have shown 70-80% effecting in reducing risk of infection in studies. The vaccines are also highly effective in reducing risk of severe infection, so reducing hospitalization and serious symptoms and lung and organ damage by COVID is reduced by taking a vaccine.
What are some Key messages that should be given to people while talking to them about COVID-19 vaccines?
WHAT SHOULD I EXPECT AFTER TAKING THE VACCINE? 
Some minor symptoms such as mild fever, fatigue, soreness, body ache, injection site soreness is normal. It is actually good as it means your body is mounting an immune response to the vaccine, do not mistake this with COVID or bad side effects.  Serious side effects are rare but if you have any serious reaction, rashes or other side effects please contact the number given by the vaccination site to report this and get support.
WHEN WILL I BE PROTECTED?
Body takes a few weeks to produce immune response against COVID after taking the vaccine. You must take 2 doses to be fully protected – you are still at risk of COVID after taking the vaccine till 2-3 weeks after the second dose. The vaccine is not 100% effective so you must continue to take all precautions, frequent handwashing with soaps and sanitizers, wear a mask and maintain 2 gaj ki doori.
What are some Key messages that should be given to people while talking to them about COVID-19 vaccines?
WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE THE VACCINE? 
If you are pregnant or breastfeeding right now the vaccine is not recommended for you as the studies that were conducted on vaccines did not include pregnant women. If you currently have covid or feeling sick / have flu its better to wait till you are feeling better- wait 15 days after healing to go get the vaccine.
ADDRESS MYTHS CIRCULATING IN YOUR COMMUNITIES 
Example: 
The vaccine does not affect fertility 
If there are rumours about what happened to someone’s -someone who took the vaccine and had some serious reaction, investigate and find out what really happened. Address concerns appropriately 
Please reach out if you have questions or doubts about things you hear in the field as vaccine roll out happens
Remember:Proactively explain side effects
New COVID-19 vaccines are reactogenic.  They are likely to cause side effects, especially after the 2nd dose.
Patients may confuse these side effects with COVID-19 or flu symptoms.
Patients may worry that the vaccine gave them COVID-19

Side effects indicate a good immune response.
Side effects are generally short-lived.
It is important to return for second dose, even if the first dose has unpleasant side effects

Common Myths on Ground
Myth : Can we take our vaccines during our period?
yes. The government has busted the myth and said it is perfectly safe to take your Covid-19 vaccine jab during menstruation.

Myth: Is there a relation between Covid vaccines and heart attacks?

There is absolutely no relation between Covid vaccines and heart attacks. There had been incidents of people having heart attacks in the period following the Covid vaccine but when it was investigated it was found that in a large population that gets vaccinated there will even naturally be certain people who will have incidents like heart attacks; this number was not much more than what was seen in the period before the vaccine.

Myth: Can people consume alcohol before or after being vaccinated?
There is no evidence so far of alcohol reducing the effectiveness of the vaccine or antibody production. Having said that, it's best to avoid alcohol intake post-vaccination as the mild flu-like illness or any reactions may be masked or exaggerated.
Common Myths on Ground
Myth : A vaccine may adversely impact your immunity

Vaccines are developed using a safe and small portion of a weakened or inactive pathogen-bacteria, virus, fungi and parasites.  If you are ever exposed to the actual pathogen, your immune system's defense mechanism automatically kicks in to fight the infection, resulting in either preventing the onset of a disease or reducing its severity

 Myth: I don't have to get vaccinated if there is herd immunity against Covid-19

Herd immunity is when most of the population becomes immune to a disease, providing indirect protection to those not immune. As the disease is very infectious, it has already overwhelmed the healthcare systems of more than one country. Also, the disease strain has shown signs of mutation, which means there is no guarantee of immunity even if you had the infection

Myth: You don't require the vaccine if you've already gotten and recovered from the virus


You don’t require the vaccine for 60-90 days after the infection, however you will need to take the vaccine for further protection once this period is over. We do not know how long the immunity from having recovered from COVID-19 lasts
Q: Is it better to get natural immunity rather than immunity from vaccines?
Explain the potential serious risk COVID-19 poses to them and their loved ones if they get the illness or spread it to others, adding that the disease can be serious even if they are not in a high-risk group.
Explain that scientists are still learning more about the virus that causes COVID-19. It is not known whether getting COVID-19 disease will protect everyone against getting it again or, if it does, how long that protection might last.

“Both this disease and the vaccine are new. We don’t know how long protection lasts for those who get infected or those who are vaccinated. What we do know is that COVID-19 has caused very serious illness and death for a lot of people. If you get COVID-19, you also risk giving it to loved ones who may get sick. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine is a safer choice.”
Q: Do I have to continue to wear a mask and avoid close contact with others after I have been vaccinated?
Explain that there is not enough information currently available to say if we can stop recommending that people wear masks and avoid close contact with others. Factors that are being considered include how many people get vaccinated and how the virus is spreading in communities.
Explain that we don’t yet know if the vaccine reduces transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Emphasize that these precautions will need to be observed until the vaccine is in widespread use and disease rates start to decline.

Right now, experts don’t know how long the vaccine will protect you, so it is important to keep covering your mouth and nose with a mask, washing hands often, and staying at least 6 feet away from others after getting each dose of the vaccine. We also know not everyone will be able to get vaccinated right away, so it’s still important to protect yourself and others.  Everyone who gets vaccinated should continue taking these precautions until the vaccine is in widespread use and COVID-19 rates have declined.

Milestone – How far I have come against the over all achievement (Check point of progress)

Anything which has to be complete/ achieve the milestone we need to stack under the milestone in subtask

Show some examples – Convert projects to milestone and vice versa (Project the screen and show them)

It needs to have start and end date

Tag to the right folder (show how to tag into the folder)

Every task needs to have an assignee

Proper naming guideline of the task – It should be very clear and specific who is the client (Project report) since we will have more client reports.

When you assign or tag the task to the person?

Assign to any person for the action to be performed and other members will be for FYI



If last person – Unassing the task then we need to tag it back to the creator

Every task should have the assign who does the work

Workflows –What are the workflows, which one to use when? (It is confusion which one to use where and when)

Spaces – Folder – Projects and Tasks

Folder – Folder helps to organise the data that is being stores in Wrike. Folders can be used as buckets to house projects and tasks (or Just a place where we need a group task need a folder)

Projects are the initiative containing several interconnected tasks that are dedicated to achieve a single goal with a deadline.

Or we can say any initiative with start and end date and report the progress

Task are the main actionable units in Wrike, they keep track of what needs to be completed.

Subtask – Are smaller units of work that needs to be done to complete the parent task.

Milestone is a specific point in time within a project lifecycle used to measure the progress of a project toward its ultimate goal.

Milestones are also useful for communicating project success

When to use milestones https://help.wrike.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/211752629-When-to-Use-Milestones



Create a project to complete a webinar

Write a script

Send invitation

Prepare the slides

Dry run the webinar

Collect the statistics

Recurring task:

Use recurring tasks to create and manage a chain of repetitive tasks.Any task that will happen multiple times throughout your project's life cycle can benefit from being set as a recurring task. Some examples include:

Weekly, biweekly, monthly, or quarterly meetings / Reports

Regularly scheduled audits or testing activities

Monthly rental, statutory payments,AMCs






Tagging : To share work in Wrike using tagging, Tagging enables folders, projects and tasks to live in multiple locations

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w5v1Hlyk3s

For example the communication team has a project that involves program and finance team.

Two ways of doing this – Add + symbol to tag or drag and drop from left panel to right near + symbol

Another way to share items to users is to at “@” users or groups in comments – start typing the team name ,then they will receive a notification in there in box.

Also we can add followers to the task by clicking on the follower icon and they will be receiving all the relevant updates","task milestone, workflows workflows, reports assign, training guidelines, tag folder"

Operationalization
For the Pilot, we will follow 3:3:30 plan 
3- Locations (Proposed: Hyderabad, Banglore, Kerala)  
3- Issues/Areas of interest (decided  by the local partners)
30- Champions (10 in each location) 
Representation across gender, marginalized communities, vocations (organized/unorganized sectors), socio-economic, backgrounds, specially abled public profile and reputation etc)
‹#›
Locations for Pilot
Criteria developed for shortlisting
Accessibility to/presence of government liaisons 
Presence of Host Organization/primary implementation partner
Presence of/accessibility to potential Ambassadors
Statistics of COVID-19 affected individuals in the state 
A five-point scale was used and different locations considered
Here is the list of locations
Hyderabad (20/20), Banglore (20/20), Kerala (18/20) ranked high on all criteria; heavily in the south
Decision needed today on final locations
‹#›
Packages
During the pilot, each location will prioritize 3 issues to focus on 
Relevant issues have been identified 
through secondary research and experience of COVID positive people 
Broadly classified under -Mental Health, Quarantine/ Hospitalization Facilities,  Stigma, Support for Families and Specially-Abled Persons (details are here)
Packages for each have been developed 

From the above list of issues and packages, the local team will select and decide on how to move forward
‹#›
Local Partners/Host Organisation
A systematic process to identify  the HO/Local partner; criterion such as - 
Profile and presence of the organisation
Association with the government and liasoning 
Willingness to take up the program
Roles of the Local partners/Host Organisation 
Decide on the issues to be tackled as per the areas of operation 
Implement the package selected 
Adaptation of the package as per the local dynamics and need 
Work with various stakeholders as per the need
The partners  will be provided advisory and strategic support by the CAC as requested for or required through the pilot stage and beyond
Ultimately, we envision a fully-sustainable system, handled entirely by the onground network team in the respective location who will ensure end-to-end implementation with minimal support or involvement from CAC.
‹#›
Ambassadors
Ambassador will be people who are directly or indirectly affected by COVID19
Ambassador  has a strong local or national appeal with respect to their body of work in their respective fields, or otherwise in the context of social issues
Ambassadors will be key to driving the program by creating impact
Ambassadors along  with the host organization will  identify the issues and decide on the areas of operations 
The implementation partners can co-create  in onboarding the potential ambassadors for the location
